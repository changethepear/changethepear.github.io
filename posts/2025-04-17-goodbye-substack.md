hi guys. i’ve become aware that substack [loves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack#%22Substackers_Against_Nazis%22) [to platform](https://archive.is/uyugO) [and pay revenue to](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/pressure-builds-newsletter-company-substack-stop-paying-nazi-writers-rcna132593) [nazis, fascists](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/substack-announcement-bari-weiss-free-press) and [transphobes](https://yanyiii.com/the-freedom-of-hate/?ref=the-reading-newsletter), as well as declaring that [elon musk and donald trump protect free speech](https://post.substack.com/p/the-fight-for-free-speech-in-2025). this disgusts, horrifies and nauseates me and i’ve removed change the pear from substack. i really want to keep up the newsletter and i’m hoping to take this chance to actually learn to code and host my own blog and newsletter. it is probably going to take me a while to figure out, so until then, i’ve put up the archive of change the pear on mataroa. i'll migrate my subscriber list over so hopefully you’ll get an email when the next one comes out.  

thank you for reading and caring about this newsletter. i’ll see you soon. 🍐
