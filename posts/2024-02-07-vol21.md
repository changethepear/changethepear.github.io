hello. january felt particularly long and brutal this year, so absolutely good riddance to that, although the grey dreariness of february isn’t much comfort. as we head into the end of the lunar year, i’m feeling sad to let the year of the rabbit go. i wrote last year: _it’s a year of escaping demons, of running fast and free, of [being swift and full of tricks](https://kairisk.tumblr.com/post/707195561572499456/if-they-catch-you-they-will-kill-you-but-first), of becoming ungovernable_, and i think the year reflected that in many different ways. but it’s time to look ahead to the year of the dragon: a year of burning bridges, of flying on [the winds of morning](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/931-i-do-not-care-what-comes-after-i-have-seen), of myth and magic, of building a big hoard and keeping it safe.

## last seen

hana and i went to see [life unrehearsed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66VvbxyEmHU), a documentary about two old korean lesbians (kim insun and lee soohyun) and their life together in berlin. i literally cried through the entire film, right from the opening scene which shows a photograph of the two of them holding hands in a park. it’s a beautiful, tender, moving depiction of the joy and tenderness in their relationship. the film doesn’t shy away from the difficulties they’ve gone through, but it’s principally concerned with showing how much they love each other and how happy and secure their life together is. there are so many beautiful touches of domesticity, mixed with scenes showing the two of them at various protests: insun speaks at a demonstration for nurses of colour, and soohyun goes along to a renters protest to bang her drum and chant _enough is enough_. it was so incredibly moving to me to see how their life contains both struggle and joy, how much strength they give to each other, and how honest and tender their love is. god! i love lesbians! i love old asian women! i love love! 

one of my favourite sequences was watching soohyun make/mend a rainbow shawl for insun ([look at her](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2Zqy4sLa0X/) wearing it. oh my god) when it’s finished, insun wraps herself in it and dances around the room. fondly, soohyun says, “how old are you?!” and insun retorts, beaming, “love has no age!” we next see insun packing for a trip to korea. when she gets to seoul, she constructs a cross out of wood (both insun and soohyun are christian) and wraps it in the shawl. she writes a sign that says, _god loves all of us — kim insun_ and takes the cross to seoul pride. on her way there she cheekily says, “everyone’s looking at me!” to the cameraperson. she walks past police officers, homophobic religious protestors, and joins the celebration, dancing with young people, waving a light-up star wand and doing interviews. back in berlin, soohyun goes to berlin pride alone. she takes a photo with drag queens, gets emotional seeing the front of the protest being reserved for those with disabilities. the documentary maker asks her, “why don’t you and insun show much affection in public?” and soohyun responds that she gets anxious about people showing them hate or disrespect because of it; so they don’t often hold hands in public. the next day, insun comes along to the parade with soohyun, and we see them holding hands in the midst of it all. what an absolute privilege to be let into their lives for a brief moment. feel very grateful to have seen this documentary.

## currently watching

after weeks of everyone in my life telling me i needed to watch the traitors, i finally sat down and watched all of season one in about the space of a week. what a fantastic show full of the most absurd characters. truly a perfect distillation of the british public at large: bigoted, easily deceived, bland, mediocre at best and actively evil at worst. with notable exceptions, of course—love you andrea, love you faye, love you amos. starting season 2 was a very funny contrast—these people are a whole different kettle of fish. we’ve still got our bigots and our bland kings and queens, but we also have people who are absolutely out for blood. their eyes are giving evil. i can’t wait! currently praying for paul’s downfall.

## reading

i hit a reading slump towards the end of january, partly because i’m actually forcing myself to stop buying physical copies of books (on that note, if anyone has any books i can borrow, let me know) and partly because i desperately just want to read A Good Book and i kept reading contemporary literary fiction books that were, tbqh, deeply mid. i’m making a pivot now to go through the pulitzer prize winners from the 90s and see how they treat me. currently i’m on _the stone diaries_ by carol shields, which chronicles the life of daisy stone goodwill, growing up first in manitoba and then in indiana in the early 20th century, and the various characters that populate her existence as she gets older, marries, has children. the latent potential of books like this lies in whether they can take the particular and open it up to the general; if they manage to make us see something of ourselves in a story that is so deeply focused on the minutiae of someone else’s life. if the author gets it right, it’s genius. if they get it wrong, it can be very, very boring. we’ll see how it goes!!
