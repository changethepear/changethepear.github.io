hello loves. here we are at the end of the year. it feels impossible to write any kind of summary of \[gestures broadly\] whatever the fuck that was, so instead i want to take this moment to say: thank you for reading this newsletter, for keeping me company through 2023. i wish you love, light, and so many moments of joy in the year to come. and as always: free palestine.

## **on repeat**

[dreamy day](https://open.spotify.com/track/4vk0If3wzFnqTsfn21HER7?si=fcdce5b44feb4179) by ATEEZ. ATEEZ came back with a new album on december 1st ready to save me from seasonal depression and it, as per usual, slaps. i woke up at 5am to watch the music video with zoë and listen to the seonghwa & hongjoong unit song (NO further comment on this.) and promptly passed out again, only to wake up to 100+ messages from zoë as they listened to the album, which i immediately returned as i did a listen of my own. when i got to dreamy day, i said within the first 30 seconds: 

_I LOVE THIS :)  
this is miriam coded  
MY HANDS ARE IN THE AIRRRRRRR  
I LOVE THIS :)  
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!! :)_

what more can i say! it’s a song to lift the spirit! _whoah-oh-oh, sing it all together_! i love boyband music! unapologetically and with my full heart!

[modern girl](https://open.spotify.com/track/0QkD6lPuggMud0k76lghGi?si=6edc02a7e99f4fde) by bleachers. sorry but jack antonoff knows what he’s doing. i love this euphoric stomping 80s dance saxophone HIT!! 

[the box](https://open.spotify.com/track/2yNgLLVN7bsoS21MZCUhQ1?si=db7a2121c8744b77) by johnny flynn. while on the way to avebury, i only wanted to listen to johnny flynn and this was the sole song of his i had downloaded on my phone. i played it over and over again. i think it’s the perfect song for the dying days at the end of the year. _leave my body, leave my bones / leave me whole and leave my soul / leave me nothing, i don’t need at all._

## **last seen**

elete, lee and i took a winter solstice trip to avebury, home of britain’s largest stone circle, built over 4000 years ago. it’s a huge dirt bank (a henge) enclosing large standing stones in a ring, with two smaller rings inside. some of the stones are gone, but what remains is astonishing. they are all different, weathered and eroded into shapes, some smooth, some rough, some with cavities and holes in. there’s something irresistible about them: as soon as we walked up to the first stones we reached out to touch, to hold, to rest against them. we walked up on the bank and had lunch (soup from a thermos for me!) and then wandered around the rest of the circle. after that we walked along a little, fast-flowing river, across muddy fields, bare and bleak, under a dramatic sky to silbury hill, a giant man-made construction of dirt and chalk. nobody knows why silbury hill was built, or what its purpose was. as we crossed the field to reach it, we noticed a moat of water around it (lee: “next time, we bring a boat!”) and it felt as though we were on a mythical quest. 

i love neolithic sites. there is something so powerful and magical about them, a place that has held significance for thousands upon thousands of years, even as their original meaning and use has faded from memory. i love how we can understand a small part of the purpose of a site, especially their alignments with sun/moonrise and the seasonal shifts, even as the bigger picture eludes our grasp. these circles and earthworks exist in a place so far outside of our understanding, and yet something about them still compels us, moves us when we set foot in these ancient sacred places.

after silbury hill, we walked to west kennett long barrow, a burial site from 3650BC. that was really amazing. we wanted to sit inside the barrow as the sun went down but there was a seance/service going on inside so instead we lay on top and talked about the past year and the one to come. i’ve been struggling to allow myself space to reflect on 2023 in a way that feels honest. by that, i mean: how to acknowledge what a hard, bleak year it’s been whilst also holding the moments up that feel joyful whilst also rejecting a linear narrative of progress (_i hit the bottom of the well but it taught me xyz and now i’m better!_) being on top of the barrow, talking candidly with lee and elete, listening to their honest reflections, helped me to articulate those feelings. as the sun went down on the darkest day of the year, i said to them, _i’ve been really brave this year,_ and they said, _you have_. and that’s enough.

## **reading**

if you’ve spoken to me about books over the last couple of weeks, you’ll have heard my rant about _my work_ by olga ravn. the blurb states that it is “a novel about the unique and fundamental experience of motherhood… \[exploring\] the thorny, twisted ties between pregnancy, maternity, capitalism, work, art, individuality, and literature”. this immediately set alarm bells ringing in my mind. anything that claims to be both unique & fundamental AND look at the links between maternity and capitalism/work had better get it right. i liked olga ravn’s previous novella, _the employees_, so much that i thought, okay, let’s give this one a go. 

i should have listened to my misgivings! this was 400 pages of tedious drivel and some of the worst poetry i’ve ever read in my life, with nothing insightful or interesting to say about postnatal depression, the work of motherhood or relations between men and women as parents. it reads as one long complaint about how hard things were for the narrator. i don’t mean to sound callous. i know motherhood is hard, and i know that postpartum depression is a serious illness. my problem was that there was no movement in the book, no progress from one state to another, no development for our narrator. she sits there, complains about giving birth, complains about pregnancy, complains about writing while being a mother, complains about her husband, who can do nothing right—he’s either being too overbearing and trying to be the child’s second mother, or he’s an absent father and a bastard. and that’s supposed to be radical? sorry, but miss me with this. also where were the actual links to politics and political economy? as far as i could tell there was only a brief mention of how the family doesn’t have much money, plus one line misreading marx completely. not to be a bitch but if you have capitalism on the back cover and the book is called My Work, you have to do a little better than that. if you are going to write a book on motherhood and pregnancy and patriarchy in 2023, you need to do a bit of analysis, a bit of digging into why things are the way they are, and what we can do to change it. the endless stasis of the narrator pissed me off! 

even worse was the ridiculous section where she starts analysing other works of literature that deal with madness and postnatal depression, citing hiromi ito’s “killing kanoko” as a revolutionary example of defiance. for context, this is a poem about killing a baby called kanoko—the name of hiromi ito’s real life daughter. i have not read it but my brief google showed me the first few lines and they were not nice. in _my work_, the narrator says “it’s ridiculous how people think the narrator of ito’s poem is wholly identifiable as her and that she would think about doing harm to her child”. can i stress, the name of ito’s child in real life is kanoko. what the fuck, guys! why is talking openly about wanting to murder your child being portrayed as some sort of heroic feminist act? am i going insane?

final thing: the number of times the narrator asserted “bad poems are okay” or “writing is allowed to be bad” or “i’m writing a bad book but i don’t care” actually had me laughing by the end. girl… you said it not me….

> Fifth, through these achievements, the Palestinian resistance has been able to present an acute threat to the settler-capitalist property structures called Israel, to militarized accumulation, to the world’s workshop for counterinsurgency technology, and to the entire architecture of regional repression with its associated petrodollar flows, treasury and security purchases, and arms merchandising. For capitalism is not just the smooth clockwork of accumulation through generalized commodity exchange and labor exploitation, it is the machinery of violence – its technology – which ensures the smooth running of the clock, the thingification of its human elements, the political decisions to maintain and rework the machinery of monopoly accumulation, and the waste of human lives which is increasingly the core Arab input into global capitalism.

> Tending—the very act of doctoring—amounts to siding, and Palestinian doctors are killed irrespective of the culpability they’re willing to articulate precisely because to act as a doctor in the face of an exterminatory project is a political act, a presentation of oneself and all the resources they’ve accumulated over decades as a final barrier against death. This, against an occupier committed to necropolitics—total control over the who and when and how of life and death, along with what happens to their bodies after. Through this lens, of course the doctor is a threat.
