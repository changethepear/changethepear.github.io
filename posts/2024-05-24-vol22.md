## **last seen (theatre)**

elete and i went to see Mother (sarah snook) in _the picture of dorian grey_, which was an incredible experience. i had no idea what to expect, to the extent where i didn’t realise it was a one-woman play. sarah snook plays every character, donning an impressive array of wigs and costumes and accents to be everyone from the fruitily evil lord henry to the depressive basil, artist of the eponymous portrait, to silly, innocent sybil vane and her brother james, obsessed with revenge. she also narrates the script, based heavily on the text of the book. oh it was so good guys!!! she is completely magnetic, inhabiting every character so fully and switching between personas at the drop of the hat. dorian himself is an incredible piece of acting, changing from wide-eyed ingenue to wicked hedonist over the course of the play. the staging was inventive and exciting too—i could have sat there and watched sarah snook standing against a blank backdrop doing the entire thing, but the way that the filming and effects were done was so clever. it enhanced the experience rather than overwhelming you, apart from one section where dorian enters an opium den-slash-techno club, where the overwhelm felt intentional. 10 stars! standing ovation! sarah snook should play every character in every novel! do dickens next, queen!

## **currently watching**

young royals is back! my boys are back! and audrey and i are seated, of course. season three opens with wille and simon, now happily and openly in a relationship, navigating their new status as out at school and out to his family. simon is receiving hate messages online, which breaks my heart, while wille is struggling with what it means that he is now a Prince With A Consort. meanwhile, sara reaches out to her estranged dad because she’s lost all her friends due to sleeping with august (evil man!!) and felice is depressed because she misses sara but is also angry with her, which she immediately confesses to wille and simon (audrey: i love how they talk about their emotions / me: they’re SO emotionally literate) imagine being a teenager and openly communicating what’s on your mind. incredible. anyway i’m obviously having a fantastic time. wille/simon forever!!!!!!

under duress (iman texting me about 300 times “when are you going to watch bridgerton?”), i have been watching bridgerton season 2, probably the most stupid television show i’ve ever seen and that is saying something. my mum raised me to be a republican and yet here i am watching these lords and ladies caper about in the most absurd american fantasy of british gentry. embarrazzing! anyway, i have to admit that i enjoy the way some of the actors absolutely relish their roles (lady danbury is eating!) and particularly the anachronistic phrases which hana and i can’t stop quoting at each other (“you CANNOT be in earnest” / “i shall see you there anon” / “we wish to discuss more intellective matters”).

### **reading**

my life has been completely taken over by _the murderbot diaries,_ a seven-book series about a robot-human construct that disables its governor module that controls its behaviour—and spends its newfound freedom half-assing its job and watching copious amounts of TV because it’s depressed and anxious. relatable, some might say!!!!! 

my biggest gripe with the vast majority of SFF is that there is no humour in the books. i’m not saying they have to be laugh out loud funny, but i would like a little lightness, a touch of the droll perhaps. instead we get reams of dry (or purple!) prose with not a joke in sight. it bores me! so i absolutely ate up murderbot’s dry witticisms and snappy internal monologue. i also loved the tightness of the plots. the first four books are novellas, each with a central mystery arc/problem that resolves itself while also giving murderbot time and space for character development. 

and the character development is the heart of the series. murderbot is a SecurityUnit, considered to be a piece of equipment by the company that owns it. the company leases it out as security protection for teams on mining installations, surveyors of planets, etc. the governor module is meant to keep it in check, preventing it from doing anything outside of its contract—it will even fry the SecUnit’s brain if it strays too far from its contracted humans. when murderbot liberates itself from the module, it continues doing its job, while spending much of its processing time secretly watching media. because when you’ve never had free will, trying to decide what you want to do is difficult. it’s the question that follows murderbot through the series, as it explores its past, tries to help humans where it can, and slowly builds connections with others. it learns about having emotions, letting people in, telling them what is on your mind. it learns to make friends, and learns that its care and protection can be reciprocated. the best relationship is its one with the consciousness running a big research ship that murderbot calls ART (Asshole Research Transport)—this too is yuri!! i loved it all, honestly. i’m so sad that i’ve run out of books in the series, because murderbot is the kind of character i can never get enough of.

## **free palestine**

[the prison as a text](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02690055.2024.2315734) by layan kayed (trans. roba alsalibi) 

The prison wants to isolate you from your people and your homeland, just as it wants to estrange you from your dream of believing ‘imprisonment’ to be the resort of dreamers. It likewise wants to alienate you from fellow prisoners and their legacy by claiming that the withdrawal of any privilege is the result of other prisoners’ misuse of it. But you, enormously grateful, know that without the years of struggle and sacrifice, prison life would have never been bearable.

[up in arms](https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/up-in-arms) by austin bilal

However, beneath the veneer of innovation and economic contribution lies the reality that arms companies are dependent on imperialism; the arms industry is geared to reap great profits from the inherent tendency towards war and military conflict within a world system of uneven exchange, and so their role in the education system is to reproduce the ideological basis for its perpetuation. As an extension of US imperial power in the region, Israel is the recipient of billions of dollars worth of arms. One wonders without such military aid and investment from Western states, whether their settler-colonial project would last a minute longer against the Palestinian resistance. 

[ICC warrants both historical and cynical](https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/icc-warrants-both-historic-and-cynical) by ali abunimah 

While Khan can attempt to market all this as demonstrating equal justice, it is no such thing: It is an outrageous and false equivalence. He could not maintain a shred of credibility if he did nothing against Israeli leaders, so he did the minimum he thought he could get away with.

But this will also be of no surprise to anyone, least of all Hamas leaders, who would have expected to be charged as the price of obtaining some measure of international justice for their people.

[‘a productive language’: on western intellectual paradigms and refaat al-areer](https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/a-productive-language) by ameed faleh 

Mikhail advocated for Palestinian intellectuals to reject material incentives, joining hands with the displaced masses for liberation, a sentiment shared by V.I. Lenin who rejected the stratum of intelligentsia that rejected their historical duty towards the land and the people. For both Mikhail and Lenin, the intelligentsia has the ability to put theory into practice and to use their knowledge for the betterment of mankind, and any role outside of this is simply rejected out of revolutionary necessity.
