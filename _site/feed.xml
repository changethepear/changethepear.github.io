&lt;p&gt;hello. we&#39;re about midway through winter over in the southern hemisphere (god willing) and the flu knocked me and hana for six towards the end of june, which i&#39;m still slowly recovering from. things in general have felt very slow here for a while now. i&#39;m trying to have patience with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;on repeat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an album for the car: bruce springsteen’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/43YIoHKSrEw2GJsWmhZIpu?si=VLZiwqvUQP-DIaENpIpdKQ&quot;&gt;born to run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;an album for writing: KAYE’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0VU94M6XiwFQcmkKLZWlBN?si=lEZOVj_fTqy0BH7KvDwW5A&quot;&gt;conscious control&lt;/a&gt; (thank you zoë for the rec)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve been feeling a little stuck music-wise lately and would love to hear new recommendations from people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;last seen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as previously mentioned, i was Not Well at the end of june, resulting in me desperately needing to watch a crime procedural. a british crime procedural, for my sins, because nobody does depressing copaganda quite like the brits. hana and i watched &lt;i&gt;dept q&lt;/i&gt; starring matthew goode as the extremely divorced detective inspector carl morck (me: is it a coincidence that it sounds like KARL MARX??? arenike: i… think so?). seriously, i think carl is the most divorced character i’ve ever come across. every single person he interacts with, he’s somehow divorced from: his actual ex-wife, his therapist, his lodger martin, his boss moira, his partner hardy (side-note: i SCREAMED when hardy said “that’s my partner” to a doctor and she replied “i didn’t know you were gay!” thank you dept q for making the joke about detective partnerships that nobody else is willing to make), his junior dc rose, and his new sidekick akram. stunning work. what a miserable man who is terrible at feelings! give me nine episodes of it please and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the actual crime that is being solved is a cold case: the disappearance of prosecutor merrit lingard. i found it pretty easy to solve, but annoyingly not only because it was fairly obvious from the clues we were given, but because of the choices made by the writers/directors/producers. for example, rose goes to the island where merrit grew up and wants to see the mother of merrit’s teenage boyfriend, who died after police were trying to arrest him for brutally beating and permanently disabling merrit’s brother, william (look, we can’t even get into the whole thing, just go with me). rose turns up at the caravan home of mrs jennings only to find oh whoops, she’s at church. seeing as we had visual footage of one of merrit’s kidnappers being an old woman who is delighting in torturing her, it was pretty obvious why we weren’t shown mrs jennings on camera. there was a twist that i didn’t see coming, but after it was revealed i just… didn’t believe in its credibility lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in general, the extended scenes of merrit being tortured inside a hyperbaric chamber that’s slowly increasing in pressure were gratuitous and not enjoyable. at first, i wanted them not to even show merrit was alive, in order to increase the suspense (and i do think that a later reveal of that fact would have been more dramatic, and cut down on the same repetitive torture scenes) but i do get that they wanted to tell a story about merrit as well as the detectives trying to solve the case. still, i enjoyed watching my new favourite divorcé and his merry men and will probably be tuning in for the next season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;currently watching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after we wrapped up &lt;i&gt;dept q&lt;/i&gt;, i immediately made hana start watching &lt;i&gt;line of duty&lt;/i&gt; with me, because she’s never seen it. we’ve just started season two and god, it is so GOOD. i feel alive. i love my best friends ds arnott, dc fleming and superintendent hastings!!! they’re here to do one thing and one thing only: catch bent coppers. more thoughts to come as we go through the seasons—i love season one, but it’s 2 and 3 that are really the standouts for me. lindsay denton here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;reading&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;recently, i picked up elisa shua dusapin’s novella &lt;i&gt;the pachinko parlour&lt;/i&gt; (tr. aneesa abbas higgins) and i can’t lie, i was expecting a 3 star piece of literary fiction that was well-written but ultimately a bit empty. for the first 50 pages, that was definitely the vibe. but by the time i finished the book, i was crying so hard i gave myself a headache. i lay in bed next to hana, gasping out sobs; every time i stopped crying i’d remember something that happened and start crying again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our narrator, claire, is a young woman from switzerland visiting her zainichi grandparents in tokyo. zainichis are koreans who have been living in japan for generations, exiled from their homeland because of colonialism, war, and the ongoing occupation of south korea (for more on zainichis, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberationschool.org/chongryon/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by derek ford). claire speaks japanese, but has lost her korean language ability; she communicates with her grandparents in broken english and korean. we slowly find out that this visit has a special purpose—claire and her boyfriend mathieu were meant to accompany her grandparents to korea, their first return since they left over fifty years prior. mathieu couldn’t come in the end, so claire takes on organising the trip. but her grandparents seem strangely reluctant, unwilling to make plans or discuss their travel. her grandfather is still working in the family pachinko parlour, even though he’s over ninety (japan has no pension scheme); her grandmother can’t leave the house on her own without getting lost and confused. their relationship with claire is strained, distant despite their close proximity and shared meals. you get the sense that neither party is being fully honest with the other. we learn that on previous visits, mathieu developed a connection with claire’s grandmother. while she never speaks japanese to claire, she was able to talk to mathieu in the language, telling him things that claire never knew about her time living under japanese occupation in korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;amongst all this, claire develops a relationship with ten-year-old mieko, who she is employed to teach french over the school holidays. mieko’s mother is a french teacher and wants mieko to study abroad in switzerland, insisting that claire call her ‘henriette’. their domestic set-up is incredibly weird: they live on the top floor of a hotel, with mieko’s room in the old pool, and they regularly eat western food, to acclimatise mieko for when she moves. instead of really teaching mieko any french, claire takes her on a series of bizarre outings: to disneyland tokyo, to the zoo, to heidi’s village. mieko is awkward around claire, and their interactions are always somewhat stilted, yet they manage to grow into a strange co-dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the scene that began my weeping session was one where claire returns home on her birthday. she’s sure that her grandparents have forgotten, so she’s made plans to have dinner with mieko and her mother (mieko invited her upon learning it was claire’s birthday). when she walks into the kitchen, she discovers that her grandparents have made her long-life noodles, set up her grandmother’s little playmobil figures so they’re all clapping, all to celebrate her birthday. her grandfather is even wearing a party hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘You should’ve let me know …’ I mutter, caught off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They gaze blankly at me. I mumble something about not being able to stay, that I have to go out, I’m going to be late, regretting every word as soon as I utter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘But you’ve been out all day,’ my grandmother says. ‘You’ve only just got home.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try and explain: Mieko and Henriette’s invitation, I’d have said no, if only I’d known. She cuts me off. I hadn’t told them my plans either. I never tell them anything. She’s even bought a chocolate cake. And as if to emphasise the point, she goes into the kitchen and comes back with a cake, iced and decorated with the number thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;claire’s relationship with mieko parallels her relationship with her grandparents: there’s so much mieko doesn’t understand about claire’s unhappiness, her feeling of displacement at being part of the diaspora, complicated by her grandparents’ position as exiles from korea and second-class citizens in japan. similarly, there is so much claire doesn’t know about her grandparents: it’s mathieu who tells her that her great-grandmother cut her tongue so she couldn’t speak japanese, because speaking korean was illegal under japanese occupation. yet the difference comes because mieko asks. she asks to see the pachinko parlour, she asks to meet claire’s grandmother, she asks about what claire’s father does. we know that claire’s grandmother communicates with mathieu in japanese and not claire. but did claire ever ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stories about asian grandparents always get me, because of my own grandmother. i recognise so much from my own relationship to her and my mum’s relationship to her in this book. the gulf of communication between you and your grandparents; how they love you so much but don’t know how to express that in ways you can understand. gestures like a surprise birthday cake, or watching all the disney films with you in a language they can’t speak, just to be close to you—those are the words they communicate with. and within the parameters of that language, one that is so bound up with duty and sacrifice, it’s hard to communicate that love back, to people who have known you since you were born. how can you even come close to doing for them what they have done for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another scene that made me cry is one between claire and her grandfather. they are finally on their way to the port town where they can take the ferry over to korea. there is still a reluctance in claire’s grandparents to take this trip; it’s clear to us that they are, in some ways, doing it for her, because this is something they know is important to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip might not work out the way I imagine, he says. I’d like to tell him that I’m not imagining anything, but he continues, punctuating his speech with lengthy pauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘When Korea was divided, we were still nationals of a unified Korea. It was called Choson. At separation, the Japanese government gave us permission to keep our Korean identity, but we had to choose between North and South. Many people chose the North, because of their family or because they considered the North more in line with our country’s traditions. There was no way of knowing how things would turn out. Your grandmother and I chose the South because we were from Seoul. That was the only reason. We knew nothing about any of the rest of it. Political questions meant nothing to us, the Cold War, Russia, the United States. Koreans who live in Japan have never known North and South Korea. We are all people of Choson. People from a country that no longer exists.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pauses. Then adds, ‘We do still have our language.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry I’ve forgotten how to speak it, I say in Japanese. If my mother hadn’t left to go abroad, if I’d been born somewhere other than Switzerland … He stops me. Asks me not to criticise my mother’s choices. He and my grandmother fled Korea so she could be born in a country free of war. He has always hated the Shiny. My mother grew up. She wanted to leave and she left. Their only desire was for her to live her life according to her own choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looks at me affectionately. And now, here I am, he says. I feel myself blushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in the end, claire gets on the boat alone. her grandparents tried, for her, but they can’t go the full distance. she has to do it alone; try to unite the complex parts of herself into one whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this book takes the classic diaspora feeling of “you left your country and now i can’t connect with you on the level that i might have been able to had i also grown up in the same environment as you” and makes it more complex and knotty because of the way that koreans were forced to come to japan, leaving behind a country that no longer exists. no wonder claire’s grandparents feel a reluctance to go back to korea—what is there left for them there? they have been away too long. but, of course, there is then the flip side of “well, we wanted you/your parent to have a good life and do what you want and to do that we had to leave and remain here in a place we hate and is eternally foreign to us”. there’s no resentment over such a huge loss, such a division from culture and home—they did it for love, for duty. their only desire was for claire’s mother to live her life according to her choices. sacrifice is the eternal theme of asianness, convince me otherwise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reading this book reminded me of a time, not long before my grandma died, when i asked her if i could interview her about her early life in china, before she left for taiwan, before she came to the us and met my grandfather. she said, &lt;i&gt;yes, yes, but finish exams first. we can talk later.&lt;/i&gt; i never ended up speaking to her about it. it’s an eternal regret i have, that i could have known her better, understood her more. there’s a whole chunk of history—my history—that i’ll never know, that i can only grasp in the broadest strokes. when i spoke to my mother about it, she said, “oh, pawpaw wouldn’t have said much anyway. she never wanted to talk about it”. reading claire’s story made me feel more at ease with believing that. sometimes we can’t express things in words. sometimes people leave things buried; because the rage and loss and alienation and loneliness that those memories bring up are tied so tightly to love, duty, devotion and sacrifice. maybe my grandma wouldn’t have been able to tell me what it was like, leaving china behind, having children in a place so foreign and hostile. i still wish i’d asked her, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;welcome to a whole new newsletter! (elete: the pear has literally been changed...) thanks for being patient with me while i battled web development and email services and eventually managed to code and host &lt;a href=&quot;https://changethepear.com/&quot;&gt;this new site&lt;/a&gt;. there might be some teething issues (let me know if you spot any!) but it&#39;s been a while since i wrote a newsletter and i really wanted to get one out as soon as i could. it&#39;s winter here and i&#39;ve been struggling to keep my head above water. i&#39;m hoping that writing this keeps me tethered; reminds me that joy is never far away. let&#39;s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;on repeat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for shinee’s seventeenth anniversary, all their old concerts were being streamed on youtube towards the end of may. i don’t feel like i’ve been around long enough to claim shawolism for myself but hana was basically born ready to watch a three hour shinee concert every evening and hayley and i were happy to support my beautiful shawol wife by watching with her. guys, shinee are so good. has anyone else heard of shinee??? the vocals are CRAZY, the performances are impeccable, they give absolutely 1000% to every song and it’s just a delight to watch. highly recommend watching this performance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io5MXNwioT4&amp;t=73s&quot;&gt;why so serious?&lt;/a&gt; to inject a bolt of pure joy into your day. honestly it’s just shinee all the way down at the moment. some current favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;last seen (concert)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just over four years ago, hayley started feeding me BTS content. a lot has changed since those early, exciting days of throwing myself wholeheartedly into obsession, but i was brought right back to them by seeing j-hope (also known as hobi, or by his government name hoseok) live in singapore. i’m half-joking when i say you don’t pick your kpop bias, your kpop bias picks you, but hobi genuinely took me unawares. i went in primed to be a jimin stan, but from the moment i saw hobi in BTS’ tinydesk concert i knew there was something about him that would always make me feel happy. so, attending the show and finally seeing him live? crazy, insane, life-changing, etc. hobi’s solo music is, by turns, fun, angsty, introspective, hopeful; i enjoy it a lot, particularly his most recent EP, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/5mqxdPWQirLBE7vdDMhlB4?si=4g96M5mSRA67FDODH12MfA&quot;&gt;hope on the street&lt;/a&gt;. but seeing the songs performed was something different. it’s not often you see someone on stage who is so perfectly at home there. when hobi is on stage dancing, performing the music he made for the express purpose of performance, you can’t imagine him being anywhere else. he loves what he does and he is incredibly, spectacularly good at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s something about hobi that is so purely joyful; maybe it’s his talent for dance that means he’s so easily able to let happiness permeate his entire body, maybe that’s just how he was born. but for all that expressing happiness comes easily to him, i love how hard he works to generate it. sarah once said to me that hobi is unafraid of letting us see how hard he tries. his fervent sincerity, the way he listens, how much he cares; nothing less than perfect is acceptable in all areas of his life and he is meticulous about achieving that. nobody works harder at, or has a bigger capacity for, love and joy; and it’s all for others. he offers it all up so freely, to the rest of BTS, to his fans, to anyone who is listening. his catchphrase is “i’m your hope, you’re my hope, i’m j-hope”. [hana, in my ear: HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPE] truer words have never been spoken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hayley and i, through the years of our friendship, have thought a lot about how to be in the world and how to be in relation with others, and our love for BTS (and their love for each other) has helped us figure it out. that’s a precious thing and not something i take lightly. it was incredibly special to be at the concert with them and hana, to dress up in our silly hats and grab our keychains and scream our lungs out for our number one boy. in the days that followed i’d sometimes stop dead and say, “wait… we saw j-hope live” and hana and hayley would echo “we saw j-hope live!!!” wow. what a world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;last seen (tv)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE PITT!!! of course it’s the pitt. i first heard about it from arenike, possessor of the most immaculate taste in media of anyone that i know, but it was only when i saw a gif of robby and langdon captioned “his alpha” that i really got interested. then kallie messaged me, “bestie are we libbing out to the pitt” and i knew it was time. i’m not usually a medical drama person so this was actually my first foray into the genre, and i was captivated from episode one. the format—every episode is an hour of a shift in the emergency department, the titular ‘pitt’—helps the show accurately capture the chaos of an emergency room that’s chronically underfunded and understaffed. the tension builds through the snowballing scenes of doctors rushing from patient to patient while more pile up in the waiting room and the next case that rolls through the doors from the ambulances could be anything from a drowned child, a gunshot wound, mysterious seizures, a heart attack, severe burns… a few dear friends of mine are hospital doctors and the show really hammered home that their jobs are so much more intense and insane than i could ever imagine. seeing scene after scene of what healthcare professionals have to stay calm, professional and level-headed through… i couldn’t even survive one hour of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the show’s realism, its focus on the &lt;i&gt;medical&lt;/i&gt; part of the medical drama, is one of its major strengths and part of what makes it so gripping, but if that was all i was interested in, i’d ring up surina or sakina or lucy and ask them to describe their days to me. the magic and joy of tv is that it gives us a fictional world to live in for a little while, shows us flawed characters who are challenged and questioned and confronted by the scenarios they’re in. the show presents us with several interesting, complex people who each have their own vulnerabilities and failings, both individually and professionally, and shows how those two spheres intersect, in moving and empathetic ways. there are no villains here, only people who are trying their best, sometimes failing—sometimes failing &lt;i&gt;spectacularly&lt;/i&gt;—fucking up and picking themselves back up. the format of a single shift does limit how much character growth or development can take place—it’s only one day! they ain’t got time to develop—but where it lacks in change, the pitt delivers depth in spades. langdon and his drug-stealing, dana and her moment of I Can’t Do This Anymore after getting assaulted by a patient, santos and her abrasiveness and lack of humility, robby and his inability to confront his own grief. every character is so rich, has so much to offer, and is given space to show all the facets of their personality. i can’t wait to see where they go next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;reading&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;early june in the southern hemisphere = early december in the northern hemisphere. needless to say, i’m underneath a blanket and i’m back on the tana french train. i’m on book 5/6 now and i am once again blown away by how talented a writer she is. not only are the books filled to the brim with lucid, gorgeous prose, but the way she navigates first-person narration is actually genius. each book clearly, subtly shows the gulf between her narrators’ own perceptions about themselves and what they are actually like. even the most self-aware of the lot still gets deftly deconstructed like a frog on a dissection table. the tragedy and pathos of these novels comes from the fact that most of the characters, despite being forced into some kind of reckoning, still return to take refuge in their own fantasy land of self-perception, because to step outside of it would mean utter annihilation of everything they believe to be true about themselves and the world. chills!!! the only two who manage to come out better are conway and steve, because at the crucial moment, when they are about to step directly off the precipice—they reach out a hand, and they trust in someone else. and after reading the trainwreck of cassie, frank, rob and scorcher’s narrations, what a bloody relief that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cassie/rob are the biggest steve/conway foil, obviously, because of the partnership, but also because both cassie and rob are predestined for tragedy yet are offered so many points to get out of the speeding car before it hits the guardrails and wrecks itself. rereading &lt;i&gt;in the woods&lt;/i&gt; (rob’s book) is 10000x worse and emotionally torturous when you know what’s coming. rob’s self-flagellating narration means it’s obvious that he fucks it all up, even when though you don’t know how, but upon this reread, knowing how it ends meant i could pick up more keenly on the stupid wallowing-in-my-own-misery hints he drops the entire way through. i was struck again by how he is actually quite self-aware, just not enough not to fuck everything up irredeemably. on some level he knows what’s wrong with him, but he can’t stop it. it’s almost like he wants to be this way, like he can’t see a way to being happy or well-adjusted or loved. and that’s why he’s so vulnerable and easy to manipulate because he’s terrified of anything real, he’d rather believe in a fantasy. he has no concept of the reality of relation—he can’t, because to reckon with it would be to properly reckon with everything that he’s lost. he can’t let it slip that he’s actually not in control of anything, because to confront that would be to confront the moment when he had the least control of all—when jamie and peter were taken from him and he was left behind. ugh. CRAZY!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don’t even get me started on cassie. you read rob’s book and you feel so bad for her being collateral damage in rob blowing apart his own life, and then you read &lt;i&gt;the likeness&lt;/i&gt; and you’re like oh okay this bitch is crazy too… she’s so traumatised and she wants to belong so desperately and she’s hurting so much from losing rob that she launches herself immediately into another insane codependent relational scenario that is obviously, painfully doomed from the start due to the fact that she is an &lt;i&gt;undercover police officer impersonating one of the members of said fucked up codependent relational scenario who has just been murdered&lt;/i&gt;. and when that all goes to shit she goes home and is like, well i guess belonging irrevocably and completely to someone ain’t for me, go on sam (her boring yokel boyfriend) put a ring on it. utterly balls-to-the-wall INSANE. cassie… relation doesn’t have to be like this… i promise… but again, to throw yourself openly into the breach of relation when you know you could be hurt so badly—that’s the hard part of being alive. it’s so much easier for cassie to settle and chain herself down, much easier for her to believe that she can’t ever have such pure, sweet belonging without pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on a different note, i also finally finished &lt;i&gt;the long transition towards socialism and the end of capitalism&lt;/i&gt; by torkil lauesen and loved it. a clear-sighted, incisive, balanced and—crucially!!—dialectical critique of previous attempts to build socialism (NOT the social democracy kind) and the form of socialist transition taken by revolutionary movements once state power has been seized. in particular the strength of lauesen’s analysis comes from his clear articulation of contradiction. he outlines how contradictions on both a global scale and a local scale (typically within a nation-state) interplay and require careful thought to identify what the principal contradiction of a current time period is; and ensures that he himself identifies the contradictions at play when he writes about historic and current attempts to build socialism. honestly guys, not to be lame but i love being a marxist. i love reading analysis like this that makes so much sense, that is able to ruthlessly criticise while also moving towards something constructive. lauesen doesn’t idealise previous attempts at socialism, but nor does he tear them down;  rather he explains their gains and successes, the conditions under which countries were operating, and looks to understand why mistakes were made and how they might be avoided in the future. towards the end there are sections that could do with expansion (e.g., the section on brics was fairly brief) and the editing gets a little sloppy. still highly recommend for anyone calling themselves a marxist and hoping for the end of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! it feels strange to be going into autumn in april, but such is my cross to bear. march was a strange month: after the joy of claire’s visit, i felt muted emotionally and battered physically. i’m trying to be patient with myself and hope that april brings a more even keel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;on repeat&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1SsyXtMR9nDhGCqJeWPB0r?si=11532eea958248ae&quot;&gt;can we talk about isaac?&lt;/a&gt;, rachel chinouriri / real lover girls STAND UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/79ckbJiCdKrGYPTmpFlc7u?si=64d6b7f8eb5744f2&quot;&gt;SHELL (OF A MAN)&lt;/a&gt;, saya gray / love love love this whole album&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1843y7Qr7Dp0pvkwbmukUP?si=f2d110c434914ddf&quot;&gt;beauty school&lt;/a&gt;, christian lee hutson / played to me by claire in the car, some absolute lyrical bangers in here&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1oze9aaxoRs5kPvQVWsk0Q?si=14922112a0364c8b&quot;&gt;please don’t move to melbourne&lt;/a&gt;, ball park music / a song for a sunny day with a light breeze and the windows open &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/20VA6k70DYLmIaVbZhfRZG?si=20709f3799f9421d&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, djo / i hope you guys understand that i mean this as a strong endorsement—this song sounds like a glee song&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;currently watching&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;back in february i became briefly obsessed with the story of luka dončić, a basketball player whose trade from the dallas mavericks to the los angeles lakers was so shocking that people believed that commentators announcing it had been hacked. it confused me (guy who knows nothing about the NBA) so asyi had to explain that the mavs had the random luck to draft a top young european player (dončić) and since then have steadily been building a team around him, as he grew into being one of the stars of the NBA. and then they traded him away to the lakers “for a pack of peanuts”. it’s been suggested that it was an under-the-table deal done to ensure the lakers remain the face of the NBA after lebron retires. the fury that mavs fans felt was because over the years, dončić never wanted to leave dallas; he kept affirming his commitment to the city, the fans, the team. even his official statement on the trade heavily hints that it wasn’t his choice. the whole saga made me feel depressed at the state of modern sports teams—the endless cycle of managers, players, etc that just keeps spinning faster than you can keep up. not to sound 5000 years old, but what happened to being a team? what happened to giving people time to realise potential? to finding players that pair right together, that make a cohesive whole? what do i know, i’m just a random 27-year-old woman who used to be obsessed with manchester united, but nothing about club football brings me joy any more and i can’t help but feel like it’s something to do with the way that money shapes and structures almost everything to do with the sport. (and also, needless to say, its tolerance for sexual abusers.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;anyway, shortly after this news broke i was lying on the sofa with cramps and feeling sorry for myself, and i decided i wanted to rewatch &lt;em&gt;the last dance&lt;/em&gt;, the netflix documentary that chronicles michael jordan and the bulls’ record-breaking, belief-defying six championship wins. i love this documentary. when abeera and i first watched it, we watched about 3 episodes at a time, because i was so gripped by it. it’s the sheer joyful disbelief of just how good michael jordan is; it’s how every single person interviewed still &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; every emotion they had at the time, years later; it’s MJ being the king of petty (“and i took that personally”); it’s the inevitable arc towards glory and the unpredictable nature of sport; it’s about the players’ love for the game and for each other; it’s about an entire city transformed (“mom and dad said we could either have presents under the tree or go to see a bulls game”). the documentary is about michael jordan and his greatness, true, but it also takes time to highlight that he couldn’t do it alone. he needed scottie pippen and dennis rodman; he needed a team of people who wanted so badly to live up to his expectations that they worked their asses off; he needed phil jackson and his triangle offence. it’s not quite “there’s no i in team” because there is the best basketball player who ever lived and it’s michael jordan (the moment where he switches direction and just hangs in the air, three seconds on the clock, and sinks the shot…. i paused it and made hana sit down to watch with me). but it quietly affirms that being the GOAT can only take you so far. to do what he did with the bulls—win and win again, and win one more time, and then do it twice over—the whole team needs to pull their weight. and they do, and it’s magical.  could something like that ever happen again? the hope feels ever slimmer as sports teams increasingly turn into corporations fueled by capitalist greed. but there’s always hope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;last seen&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the last forty minutes of the return of the king, on their first night, claire so tired they were like, “is this what dying feels like?” while hana and i cried our eyes out at frodo and sam’s final steps up mount doom, the fellowship’s final desperate stand, the final goodbye and journey into the west on the final ship. entering for the very last moments really hammered home how frodo’s task takes everything he has, every last shred of courage and willpower while being torn apart by forces nobody else could understand. a masterpiece!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;die hard. what is there to say? this is a perfect movie. so funny, so well-paced, alan rickman is impeccable, so many unbelievably good one-liners. yippee kai yay motherfucker!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the bourne identity. not as perfect as die hard, mainly because it is too concerned with interiority rather than bruce willis quipping like his life depends on it. it wants to both be an action movie and deconstruct action movie heroes and therefore it can never quite succeed at either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;in and out. new to me and i had the best time. i love being gay. i love gay people. macho man scene gets 10/10 as does the scene where kevin cline’s student is like “of course people think you’re gay, you BIKE to school”, because i had said the same thing about five minutes before. it’s okay to stereotype when it’s funny! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the polka king. FIVE STARS… jan lewan the polka king, claire’s mum’s irl friend, has a wild life story and jack black puts his entire pussy into playing it onscreen. you have to see it to believe it. there’s such warmth, humour and heart to this movie. now i’m rapping polka ! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;reading&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;imagine you’re six years old and you’re the bastard son of the king-in-waiting except when your existence is revealed he abdicates the throne (and later dies so you actually never saw him at all) and then you’re taken to the court to grow up but nobody really takes an interest in you except your father’s old right hand man who happens to be the stablemaster (dad stand-in number 1) except one day the king notices you and decides to turn you into a weapon so you then start getting assassin training in secret from the king’s bastard brother (dad stand-in number 2) but nobody can know about it and then you start seeing the king’s fool around and he sometimes says weird riddles or sings a love song to you and so you’re kind of friends but you also don’t know if he’s mocking you so honestly you don’t really think about it much and then your youngest uncle tries to murder you like three times and also frame you for murder when you’re on a diplomatic mission to try and find your other uncle (now the king in waiting, but most importantly dad stand-in number 3) a wife but you somehow survive and secure the diplomatic marriage but now youngest uncle is out baying for your blood. oh and in the midst of all this you realise you also have a type of despised magic that means you can bond with animals and nobody knows except the stablemaster who also despises you for using it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;anyway then you’re back at court and you secretly bond with a wolf but honestly that’s the least of your problems because the king is dying and your assassin mentor (also the king’s bastard brother, see above) keeps being really weird about it and also your kingdom is at war with these red ship raiders and you have to go and fight off enemies with your axe and then your uncle who’s the king-in-waiting goes off on a quest to reawaken these ancient beings called the elderlings and meanwhile your youngest uncle is draining funds and partying and calling himself king-in-waiting while also slowly draining the life force from the actual king and trying to kill you and your absent uncle’s wife and her unborn child so you and dad stand-in number 2 hatch a plan to spirit her off to the mountains with the king’s fool except everything goes wrong and you get betrayed and end up framed for the king’s murder and youngest uncle arrests you and beats you and tortures you to death but you survive because you manage to soulbond into your wolf’s body and then dad stand-ins number 1 and 2 dig up your corpse and call you back into your old body. and nobody else knows you’re alive not even your girlfriend who is carrying your child but you don’t even know that because you’re kind of hopeless on picking up signs so you basically give up on things and drive away your dads and live as a man-wolf for a bit but then decide you want revenge on youngest uncle so you try to kill him but fail miserably and while you’re doing that dad stand-in 3 tells you through a command in your brain using the ancient magic of the royal bloodline (that you never quite mastered because the guy teaching it to you tried to kill you and yes you do carry an unreasonable amount of shame and self-punishment around this matter) to come find him in the mountains and assist him and you take your wolf and travel all the way there and meet some characters along the way including like 4 women who want to sleep with you because you’re really sexy even though you have no self-esteem but you’re also being pursued and hunted by youngest uncle whose underlings capture you but you escape and then get shot in the back by an arrow and you walk in agonising pain to collapse at the feet of someone who turns out to be the king’s fool and he thought you were dead this whole time and he tells you you’re beautiful twice and that he missed you and presses his brow to yours and says “if there is another my fate is twined around, i am glad it is you” and also tells you that you are destined to save the world together which he already kind of told you and you didn’t believe him but now that shit is getting kind of real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and then you somehow recover from this arrow wound that probably should have killed you and you go on a quest with the fool and your uncle’s wife to find your uncle (the good one) while being pursued by your uncle (the bad one) and eventually you find good uncle carving a dragon out of stone and to make the dragon you need to dip your hands in liquid magic and put all of your memories and sense of self into it and he’s been doing that alone but when you get there he manages to get help from one of your party so he can complete the dragon but before he disappears into the dragon bodyswaps with you so he can have sex with his wife one last time to produce an heir. oh also btw remember dad stand-in number 1? he’s now in love with the woman who you thought was the love of your life and also has had your bastard child so you end up putting some of your own pain into a dragon and while all of this is going on it seems like the fool is making more and more predictions that turn out to be true so maybe his whole thing about being a prophet is real and then good uncle puts himself into the dragon and then it turns out that you can awaken more stone dragons using your animal bonding power and they all fly away to defeat the red ships and save the kingdom and you decide to stay behind and before the fool leaves he kisses you on the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;all this AND MORE happened to my good friend fitzchivalry farseer. read assassin’s apprentice, royal assassin and assassin’s quest if you want to suffer like me!

&lt;p&gt;hello! it’s time to close out the year of the dragon and enter the year of the snake, a year of outgrowing your past self, of discarding what doesn’t feel right, of wisdom and transformation and renewal. let’s go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’re in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7J2xqWWJK32BzfdLgdJe0C?si=35dcb93242934183&quot;&gt;take that renaissance period&lt;/a&gt;. if anyone has any questions, please direct them to alfie who has been trapped in the, as they put it, gary-robbie(-mark, occasionally) psychological torture vortex for decades and has an extensive primer and playlist, which means i am now in possession of knowledge that harms and upsets me. did you guys know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1hrsEHe39nYu1pJx0Nrxd7?si=666df0876db54a8e&quot;&gt;shine&lt;/a&gt; was actually about robbie williams, written by mark owen? now you do. &lt;em&gt;you… you’re such a big star to me…. you’re all that matters to me…&lt;/em&gt; okay. OKAY??? in fact many of the songs mark has written (solo and for take that) are about a mysterious someone who he adores and idolises and misses. much to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mark had his heart broken when robbie left take that (source: gary barlow) and recent investigation of the archives has uncovered several quotes from both of them which have been very damaging to my psyche, including mark saying that having robbie beside him makes him feel complete and that “rob still… has always been in take that”, and robbie saying that “when i think about mark i cry”. pain misery suffering etc. robbie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqB_As99j4Q&amp;amp;ab_channel=nuttys66&quot;&gt;brought mark on stage in 2003 to sing back for good&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very crazy song to choose to perform with your former bandmate while he snuggles into your side adoringly. in MY opinion!!! &lt;em&gt;no more fighting……and forever we will be…… so complete in our love……&lt;/em&gt; anyway thank god there is a happy ending to all this torment. we’ve all seen the take that reunion on x factor, i’m sure, but in case you’ve forgotten: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPXASNCZrio&amp;amp;ab_channel=JoinTheBizzo&quot;&gt;here it is&lt;/a&gt;. (hana [through tears]: that was real…. that was REAL. iman: nothing can ever replicate the intensity of that night of their reunion btw. mark and robbie……)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mark and robbie indeed. gary barlow and robbie williams are a whole other story, from initial antipathy/personality clash as teenagers to full-blown hatred throughout their twenties to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv49bC5xGVY&quot;&gt;music video&lt;/a&gt; where they take their shirts off while gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes and prepare to jump off a cliff together. nothing has ever gagged me as severely as seeing this music video for the first time btw. i could not believe my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being serious, i think the robbie/gary relationship is actually very moving and poignant. to be thrust into fame, particularly of the boyband variety, at such a young age is bound to wreak absolute havoc not only on you, but on your relationships as well. the thing about boybands is that their success is often made by these deep, profound connections between their members. and the other thing is that they’re just as often broken by the ruptures of said connections. they provide both the ingredients for these relationships and also for their destruction, because while your closeness with the other members is encouraged and facilitated both by the fans and the management and the desperate need for connection and closeness with the only other people who understand your specific situation, the pressure cooker environment you’re in will inevitably deepen and intensify any existing cracks. robbie’s departure from the band was something he blamed gary for, and he exercised his hurt in very public displays of cruelty towards gary (and the band in general), refusing to rejoin the band when they reunited in 2005. but eventually reconciliation did happen, robbie recorded a whole new album with take that and they performed their iconic song &lt;em&gt;the flood&lt;/em&gt; live on x factor in 2010. what a time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;robbie has spoken very candidly on many occasions about his mental health and struggles with addiction. i was particularly moved by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DCd76Fpu_FE&quot;&gt;this letter&lt;/a&gt; he recently wrote to their old manager; his honesty in reflecting on how being part of take that hastened those struggles and was a very difficult and horrible time for him at a very young age—but also he doesn’t hide behind being unwell, or young, as an excuse for his treatment of gary and the hurt that he’s inflicted. i think it’s remarkable to come to such self-awareness about your mistakes, to have humility enough to embark on a bridge-building process with the person and people you’ve mistreated, and also an understanding that forgiveness does not totally remove the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also (last thing i promise) whatever else we may feel about gary barlow, i have to hand it to him: he can write a song. &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Take-that-back-for-good-lyrics&quot;&gt;in the twist of separation, you excelled at being free&lt;/a&gt;? sir?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the traitors. obviously it’s the traitors. i’m typing this ahead of episode 10, so who knows what is in store during the final 3 episodes, but i am PRAYING for minah to somehow come out on top. she can’t be that taken in by charlotte, right? the welsh accent isn’t really doing the trick of making charlotte seem trustworthy. right???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love this show. i love how stupid the british public are, i love when random beef starts for no reason, i love when people get bitchy and self-righteous, and i love when the entire round table turns on someone because they say one thing that is immediately deemed &lt;em&gt;one hundred percent traitor behaviour&lt;/em&gt;. i said to hana and matthew that i really would love to see a traitors series full of the It’s A Game type (dan, alexander, etc) to see how these pure strategists try to outmanoeuvre each other. obviously this would run alongside another series with people who start beefing 20-year-old boys for saying they’re in a clique and people who get pissed off because they get out of a rowing boat of their own accord and nobody else does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my worst enemy of this season is obviously joe, who is a clown and a fool and pissing me off every time he opens his stupid mouth to ask people why they didn’t vote for him to get a shield because he’s clearly the most trustworthy person, or to be rude to someone for no reason whatsoever (because they’re a doctor? because they were tired after doing all the work in the challenge that you were too weak to do?) or to say it’s absolutely definitively someone only to be proved absolutely wrong five seconds later. I HATE HIM!!! my other worst enemies were livi and every single person who started saying “but why am i still here?” um… maybe because the traitors can only kill one person each night and they’re being strategic! for god’s sake! i think you people are thinking about yourselves way too much or whatever jemima kirke said!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edit after episode 10 to add: the euphoria of finally booting joe off absolutely dampened by minah’s exit. feel like pure shit just want her back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had a whole tirade ready for launch in this substack about a certain fantasy series i’ve been reading lately, when shireen informed me that most people’s deep love for the books probably stems from reading it when they were adolescents. at which point i had to take a step back and say, &lt;em&gt;am i really going to go on a rant about a book which is, technically, for children?&lt;/em&gt; while it is my belief that the best and most worthwhile children’s literature should hold up to adult scrutiny, when i lent ames my copy of &lt;em&gt;princess academy&lt;/em&gt; (a teen favourite that i still have deep affection for now) and they were like, “miriam… it’s not good”, i knew they were probably right but it was still hard to hold space for. and so, out of respect, i am going to choose the path of peace. but if you’re interested, the tirade does exist and i am willing to share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;otherwise, it’s been a pretty good month for books! i can’t pick one in particular to talk about, so i’ll do summaries of everything i’ve read so far in january:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;blood sweat glitter&lt;/em&gt; by iona datt sharma. short and sweet! the enemies-to-lovers romance wasn’t developed super well, but i really enjoyed the depiction of trying to find purpose and community in london in your mid-to-late twenties. haha lol !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;trash&lt;/em&gt; by sylvia aguilar-zéleny. loved this short novella, centred around the municipal garbage dump in ciudad juárez, mexico. incredible voice in this one and the characters were so vividly depicted. i wish it had been longer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;solar storms&lt;/em&gt; by linda hogan. i had never heard of linda hogan before reading about her on kat’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://earswithknife.substack.com/p/backlist&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of 2024 book reviews, but i am so glad i found this book. i wrote a longer review for my bookstagram, which i will be posting once the book (from the us, via claire in london) arrives with me in february, so look out for that! i’m not sure i’ll read a more evocative book this year. so deeply felt and full of grace. read if you like louise erdrich, lakes, forgiveness, quiet places and the complexities of organising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;big swiss&lt;/em&gt; by jen beagin. hysterically funny. the first book in a long time to make me actually laugh out loud. the emotional core didn’t hit as hard as i think the author perhaps intended it to, because i was essentially reading it as a satire of how tapped americans in upstate new york can be. the therapy sessions the main character is transcribing, by a bookie therapist who has taken Om as his name, truly had me howling. read if you liked &lt;em&gt;all fours&lt;/em&gt; by miranda july but wished that everyone in the book was just that little bit extra batshit insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;years and years&lt;/em&gt; by hwang jungeun. love love loved this book. really thoughtful depiction of the lives of three korean women (one mother, two daughters). unexpectedly moving and has a quiet fierceness to it. really great example of how to write political fiction, by simply depicting characters whose lives are politicised; politics is happening &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; them, not around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;madonna in a fur coat&lt;/em&gt; by sabahattin ali. that’s the last time i take a book rec from twitter. i was moved by parts of this short novel but essentially it is 1920s turkish john green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;fight night&lt;/em&gt; by miriam toews. amusing and poignant family saga, but i was left wondering about the 9-year-old narrator, swiv, and her wellbeing. she is dealing with a lot of family trauma and has far too much responsibility on her shoulders for her years, and i didn’t feel like the narrative really dealt with it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;vanity fair&lt;/em&gt; by william makepeace thackeray. i love you becky sharp… read if you like dickens but you wish he was less sentimental and more focused on cracking the whip of satire at regency society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my grandma greeting us with “where’s my lovely hana?” the sound of the trees in the wind in kalamunda. big tapestries at the cultural centre. a sunset walk with hana down whistlepipe gully. the kookaburras laughing. hana dancing with lucia. making a big fish with erin on christmas day. my grandma’s delight at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ianlawson.com/books/from-the-land/&quot;&gt;big photography book&lt;/a&gt; from the outer hebrides. enzo holding the lead in his mouth when we walked him. walking over the craggy limestone of the henderson cliffs and seeing a white-bellied sea eagle. birdwatching with matthew and romesh. grilled squid and a scallop on the side. listening to angels five times in a row in the car. spotting an eastern blue tongue lizard on my way home. watching canberra united WIN!! hanging out with sophie, cathy, ash and morgan. elete selecting new photos for a photo frame she got me. the matching necklaces that rachel made for us. buying shorts from the boys’ section. wandering around the botanic gardens with bee (sunshine personified!!) and talking for hours. bright bougainvillea against deep blue skies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://soracities.tumblr.com/post/689039127192158208/a-week-after-svens-funeral-im-cooking-fish&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; compilation of excerpts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://seemoreandmore.tumblr.com/post/708086220683657216/life-while-you-wait-performance-without&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by wisława szymborska. calls with friends, which always, but especially so these days, feel like lifelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;take care of yourselves out there. see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello, it’s december and i’ve been visited by what feels like a succession of biblical plagues (insects, blood, storms). as i type this i just had to dispose of a highly venomous spider that was inside our back door. crawling to the end of the year on my hands and knees, basically. wishing you all light and ease and warmth as 2024 closes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;forget spotify wrapped. here’s my personal &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3zMtSoD3dJiEVV7A3Trlc3?go=1&amp;amp;sp_cid=5219a4eb431d041ba4463d1e38482e73&quot;&gt;top 20&lt;/a&gt; (okay, 22) songs of 2024, the songs that went triple platinum in my eardrums this year. as zoë says, a machine can never know my truest deepest feelings!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;categories are: pop girlies / fun kpop / gay kpop / crazy kpop / nostalgia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;november and december are the time of year to hole up and watch crime procedural dramas. i don’t care that it’s 30 degrees outside here, this remainds true. hana and i have been watching &lt;em&gt;slow horses&lt;/em&gt;, a show about the flops of MI5. our cringe-fail loser kings and queens have been thrown into the metaphorical dustbin that is Slough House, run by the heinous jackson lamb who enjoys nothing more than reminding everyone just how much he despises them all. gary oldman is having the time of his LIFE in this role and it’s beautiful to see. our main character is river cartwright, my flop king, who keeps fucking everything up due to his inability to knock two thoughts together in his brain. he’s perfect to me. i want to shake him like a pair of maracas. the storylines are pretty predictable, but it has moments of real tension, plus a great deal of humour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, no piece of media about the british secret services is going to be at all subversive. and the politics are not &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; by any means. but. but! i do think it’s an interesting portrayal in that the plots of this show revolve around internal politicking and attempts by the officers to one up each other—sometimes the home secretary even gets involved. it all seems to be about saving face and protecting individuals’ reputation by any means necessary (including murder), with very little focus on any supposed “national security issues” which are apparently their duty to protect us from. perhaps they were lying to us about that one too! season one shows a false flag operation set up by the deputy director general, which she then colossally fucks up when her inside man gets found out, leaving slough house to clean up the mess. in season two, an ex-KGB spy (who has the best line in the show, “they are my brothers and sisters in the fight against capitalism”….rise, comrade) goes on a revenge crusade against lamb and slough house to avenge his old employee, coincidentally the head of MI5 at the time. in season three, an MI5 whistleblower is murdered, causing the deputy director general to set the whistleblower’s ex-lover on a path for vengeance—getting the file she was attempting to leak, which will helpfully get rid of the director general and allow the deputy to take her spot. along the way, one of slough house gets kidnapped, another one tricked into breaking into MI5, and finally four of them have to fight off the head of the MI5 ‘dogs’ who is attempting to murder them on the director’s orders. see what i mean? everyone in this show is rotten to the core: selfish, ambitious, greedy, dishonest. there’s no honour in MI5. jackson lamb: &lt;em&gt;the day they introduce ethics into what we do, they might as well shut us down.&lt;/em&gt; here’s hoping!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s also new thai BL season! the ones i’ve started over the last year or so have kind of been let downs, so i have high hopes for &lt;em&gt;the heart killers&lt;/em&gt;, directed by jojo tichakorn, who recently responded to comments saying the shows he makes are “too mature and explicit and not wholesome enough” with &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/JojoTichakorn/status/1859722475715821599&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; all-time banger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i too want gay to be bad as well….anyway, so far the heart killers seems mostly ridiculous rather than heart-wrenching, but there’s another 8 or so episodes in the bag to prove me wrong. the premise: two brothers (fadel and bison) who are assassins by night, burger flippers by day. fadel is stern (“nothing to smile about in my life”), serious and committed; bison is younger, bratty, just wants to blow off some steam. kant is a tattoo artist who has been in trouble with the law for his habit of stealing cars, and has now been given the chance to erase all his charges in exchange for information on the brothers. it turns out kant and bison have met before on a one night stand, so kant decides the logical next step is to seduce him. the only obstacle is fadel, who is (rightfully) suspicious of kant and casts a very forbidding eye on him whenever he spends time with bison. in a move straight out of the taming of the shrew, bison advises kant that if he wants to date him, he’ll have to find someone for fadel. kant says: “i have just the person in mind. nobody is more shameless than him.” enter style, who is totally stealing the show for me at the moment by his attempts to seduce fadel seemingly by irritating him into submission. he turns up at fadel’s work, he follows him to the market, he even joins him on his morning jog. i’m obsessed. fadel is going to obliterate that twink and I CAN’T WAIT!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everybody who reads this newsletter must be sick of hearing about how much i love hilary mantel by now, but i’ve just reread wolf hall and i feel insane, so please indulge me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Dame Elizabeth Barton to have money to fee the hangman.’ She has five days to live. The last person she will see as she climbs the ladder is her executioner, holding out his paw. If she cannot pay her way at the last, she may suffer longer than she needs. She had imagined how long it takes to burn, but not how long it takes to choke at the end of a rope. In England there is no mercy for the poor. You pay for everything, even a broken neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one thing that always strikes me when i read this novel is how immediate it feels, how alive. we’ve all studied the tudors ad infinitum at school. we all know the story of henry viii’s wives: divorced, beheaded, died… and yet, reading wolf hall (even for the fourth time) it’s like i forget that all this history has happened. i am back there, in 1530, wondering what will happen to cardinal wolsey. in 1532, curious to see if thomas cromwell can pull it off and put anne boleyn on the throne. waiting with bated breath in 1533 to find out if anne is carrying a son. i know how it ends. we all do. and yet, hilary mantel weaves such pure magic that i believe nothing until her pen spins it out. wolsey is second-in-command of england, anne is just a lady, the baby might very well be a boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is no use to justify yourself. It is no good to explain. It is weak to be anecdotal. It is wise to conceal the past even if there is nothing to conceal. A man’s power is in the half-light, in the half-seen movements of his hand and the unguessed-at expression of his face. It is the absence of facts that frightens people: the gap you open, into which they pour their fears, fantasies, desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reading wolf hall is to gain an understanding of the hidden mechanics that grind their gears behind the pomp and circumstance. away from the drama and the spectacle of henry and his six wives are the nobles, the lawyers, the politicians—the affidavits, the bills, the contracts—that make all the wheels turn. and, in tudor england in the 1530s, behind all of that, somehow, is one man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can he explain to him? The world is not run from where he thinks. Not from his border fortresses, not even from Whitehall. The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from places he has never imagined; from Lisbon, from where the ships with sails of silk drift west and are burned up in the sun. Not from castle walls, but from counting houses, not by the call of the bugle but by the click of the abacus, not by the grate and click of the mechanism of the gun but by the scrape of the pen on the page of the promissory note that pays for the gun and the gunsmith and the powder and shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the description! london, in all her various guises, is a character in herself: streets alternately full of celebration, riots, mobs at the stake baying for blood; skies of pale april sun, summer storms, leaden grey winter. mantel can describe a setting in one sentence better than some authors manage in a whole page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the river, Rafe tells his news. The rocking of the boat beneath them is imperceptible. The flags are limp; it is a still morning, misty and dappled, and where the light touches flesh or linen or fresh leaves, there is a sheen like the sheen on an eggshell: the whole world luminous, its angles softened, its scent watery and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and of course, as well as being a deconstruction of the creation of the english church and state, as well as being a vivid depiction of tudor england in all its brutal glory, it’s also a personal tragedy, a revenge story, a ghost tale. thomas cromwell is haunted by his past: that is to say, he was made by it. he’s haunted by human ghosts, too: his father, his wife, the cardinal. all moving around his head, every day. everything he does is, on some level, to appease the ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He touches his throat, where the medal would have been, the holy medal that Kat gave him; his fingers are surprised not to find it there. For the first time he understands why he took it off and slid it into the sea. It was so that no living hand could take it. The waves took it, and the waves have it still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another man would go to Leicester to see where he died and talk to the abbot. Another man would have trouble imagining it, but he has no trouble. The red of a carpet’s ground, the flush of the robin’s breast or the chaffinch, the red of a wax seal or the heart of the rose: implanted in his landscape, cered in his inner eye, and caught in the glint of a ruby, in the colour of blood, the cardinal is alive and speaking. Look at my face: I am not afraid of any man alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;look at my face. i am not afraid of any man alive. ugh! chills!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello and welcome to november! i’m entering into my fourth month of living in australia (yikes). it doesn’t get any easier being further from friends and community back home, and i still don’t know what shape my life is taking here, but i’m taking it one day at a time. stay warm out there. i miss you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;are you guys aware of just how many bangers were released in 2008 alone? i didn’t realise what a bumper year it was until i was suggesting songs for hana’s childhood pop playlist (cut off year: 2007), being met each time with &lt;em&gt;no!! that’s too late&lt;/em&gt;, going to check and realising that yep, yet again it was from 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, i finally did it. i finished &lt;em&gt;the sopranos&lt;/em&gt;. a momentous occasion and one i’m glad to be able to write about here. i remember chronicling my thoughts on episode one when i started this newsletter and look at us now! who would have thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sopranos is a tragedy, and once i accepted that, it became… not easier exactly but less painful to watch the final seasons, once all hope of anything good happening had been extinguished. there is no escape from the soprano family’s toxic maw and there never will be. everything is consumed and the bones are spat into the trash heap. there’s a reason the show steadfastly avoids telling us anything about the one soprano (barbara, tony and janice’s sister) that has managed to live apart from the world of her family, beyond very short cameos at moments of crisis. because this show is not about escape routes, it’s not about coming out the other side and living a redemptive and honest life—or at least, a different one. the focus is on those people whose hands are stained, the people who can’t help but enjoy their complicity, as carmela tells dr melfi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i found christopher’s end so difficult for that reason. we’ve watched this boy become a man over six seasons, witnessed in minute detail his struggle with addiction, his efforts to stay clean, his relapses and his recommitments to being sober. when christopher’s addiction first prevents him from doing his job properly, tony asks uncle jun’s advice. it’s one of the most shocking moments of the entire show; uncle jun sits there and calmly tells tony that he should put christopher down as though he is a sick dog. seasons later, as we see christopher being all but forced into relapse by the cruelty of his fellow captains, as we see tony plug his nostrils to let him choke to death on his own blood, there is a sick inevitability to it. because christopher’s attempts to get sober are good and clean and true. nothing like that can survive in the soprano family, and so neither can he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s not all doom and gloom, though—the sopranos is one of the few tv shows that has consistently continued to make me laugh out loud through the seasons, maybe because it’s not actively trying to pull off gags. it just sets up the characters and their foibles and eccentricities and blindspots and lets them loose on a situation. and whether it’s vito turning out to be a bottom, silvio having to take on the role of interim boss when tony is injured christopher wanting to make a movie, carmela and rosalie exploring paris or one of tony’s extended dream sequences—the results are absurd, inappropriate and very, very funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i managed to get through all six seasons of the show without encountering one single spoiler (shoutout to abeera who patiently rewatched seasons one through four with me and didn’t breathe a word about future episodes). i’m glad of it, because i think the thrill of the show lies in its unpredictability. we know how tragedies end. but we don’t necessarily know how we get there. i knew the show was going to come down heavy on the Tony-Soprano-Is-Irredeemable side, but i could never have predicted that final scene, the final shot. is tony dead? after i finished the show i spent days trawling through old reviews, blog posts, reddit threads to read about the finale. someone has written a painstaking play-by-play of every frame in the final scene to prove that tony is definitively, without a doubt, dead as dead can be. but i’m inclined to agree with emily st. james’ assessment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point of view, it doesn’t even matter if Tony dies at the end of the series. He was given multiple opportunities to come alive and only half-heartedly grasped at a few of them. We know this man well enough now to know he will live the rest of his life—whether that’s 30 seconds or 30 years—in a state of spiritual decay as profound as the physical decay his uncle lives through… Tony, increasingly incapable of even these small moments of pleasure (though he takes a moment to look upon the trees before going to see Junior), is spiritually lost. He tried to find his way through the wilderness of his own psyche and soul, sometimes with the help of Melfi, and he ultimately failed. When he complains to A.J.’s psychiatrist about his mother in the episode, he’s back to square one. He got so lost in the maze he went right back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that’s tragedy baby! there is something so rotten at tony’s core that, in every way, is reified by the life he was born into: the violence, the whoring, the gambling, the uncontrollable rage. and it spreads and spreads until there is nothing redeemable to be found. but in the end—what’s the point of it all? tony visits uncle jun, now in a state psychiatric ward, and tries to remind him of the good old days. &lt;em&gt;you and my dad used to run all of north jersey&lt;/em&gt;, he tells junior. and junior doesn’t even register it. the whole thing is utterly futile. even the argument that tony is doing it for his children falls flat. they’re complicit, carmela reminds us, and they always have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;god, what a show. there’s so much more i could say. i want to go back and rewatch my favourite episodes—paulie and christopher in the woods, carmela and tony’s divorce argument, AJ becoming a nihilist—and honestly, maybe even rewatch the whole damn thing because i think it’s a show that would really reward that. but i think i might give myself a little break first. next up: the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on dual recommendation from matthew and eddie, hana and i have been watching &lt;em&gt;jet lag: the series&lt;/em&gt;, specifically the &lt;em&gt;tag eur it&lt;/em&gt; seasons. jet lag: the series is a webseries hosted by three nerds (sam, ben and adam) who play games across the globe, and i am obsessed with them. they begin tag eur it in a small town in france, notable for being the midpoint of three end locations: jersey, borkum and zermatt. they have three days to make it to their end location, but have to earn “coins” by doing absurd challenges in order to travel on any form of transportation that isn’t walking or running. when one person is the runner, they have a 45 minute headstart to get away from the two that are chasing them. the chasers have a live tracker on the runner, so they know where they are and have to then catch up to the runner to tag them. which is a lot easier said than done, thanks to the irregularity of european trains and the difficulty of predicting each other’s moves. sometimes they get it right, sometimes they get it very, very wrong. ben is a he/him lesbian who approaches the challenge mostly on vibes and a positive attitude, adam takes it incredibly seriously, to the point that he is in active distress most of the time (and the more distressed he gets the more his voice cracks), sam has a plan for everything and is aware of even the most obscure train stations that someone &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; go to. the way they try and outsmart and double-bluff each other leads to some ridiculous manoeuvres. it’s truly incredible stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently, i finished &lt;em&gt;the tainted cup&lt;/em&gt; by robert bennett jackson, a fantasy murder mystery set in the empire of khanum. the action takes place in the outer rim of the empire, right by the eastern seas, where massive walls have been constructed to keep out the leviathans—titanic beings that attempt to breach the walls every wet season and rampage through the empire’s lands. many of the subjects of the empire modify themselves using grafts or other concoctions, enhancing them physically or aesthetically. our narrator, dinios kol, has been modified to become an engraver, meaning he remembers everything he sees and hears, but there are darker and stranger modifications too. and the source of many of these alterations? organic matter found in the bodies of the leviathans. creepy! nasty! in the outer rim, contagion abounds. and contagion is what is suspected when a military officer is found dead, killed by the sprouting of a patch of trees erupting from his chest. an investigator called ana dolabra and her stolid assistant, dinios, are called on to solve the crime. ana swears a bit too much for my liking—i’m not prudish about language but it did feel a bit grating to read through speech littered with fucks on every page. but she is a detective in the true holmesian tradition: reclusive, unwilling to modify herself for anyone, curious, deductive and experimental. she eats raw meat and wears a blindfold to avoid overstimulating the senses. in her wake trails dinios, acting as ana’s eyes and ears at crime scenes. it’s a lot of fun, the worldbuilding was well-thought out and executed, and it’s even gay! what’s not to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it not violent for a child to go to bed hungry in the richest country in the world? I think that is violent. But that type of violence is so institutionalized that it becomes a part of our way of life. Not only do we accept poverty, we even find it normal. And that again is because the oppressor makes his violence a part of the functioning society. But the violence of the oppressed becomes disruptive. It is disruptive to the ruling circles of a given society. And because it is disruptive it is therefore very easy to recognize, and therefore it becomes the target of all those who in fact do not want to change the society. What we want to do for our people, the oppressed, is to begin to legitimatize violence in their minds. So that for us violence against the oppressor will be expedient. This is very important, because we have all been brainwashed into accepting questions of moral judgment when violence is used against the oppressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the liberal really wants is to bring about change which will not in any way endanger his position. The liberal says, “It is a fact that you are poor, and it is a fact that some people are rich; but we can make you rich without affecting those people who are rich.” I do not know how poor people are going to get economic security without affecting the rich in a given country, unless one is going to exploit other peoples. I think that if we followed the logic of the liberal to its conclusion we would find that all we can get from it is that in order for a society to become equitable we must begin to exploit other peoples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, we owe much of the development of the movement to October 7; so too, the fledgling Western left. It would be easy to become complacent or disillusioned by what has followed, but we have obligations to the martyrs, to the prisoners, and to all who fight to end this. Here, hundreds of thousands have been mobilized, joined new organizations, confronted the campus and the state. They have Gaza to thank for this, but it is not enough. Israel is the model for a global future, of fully-realized 21st century fascist nations. Its blueprint is in reinforcing duality with the American security state: the same technologies, strategies, and rationalizations will be brought to bear on coming waves of climate refugees and the lumpenproletariat who will strain the edges of the prison or ghetto. The consolidation of the means of mass death production in the hands of the ruling class and their media accomplices is a convalescent prologue to the coming decades of catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a normalcy that should not be normal, and each of our martyrs fought to end it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My message to the international community is that one of the motivations behind the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation was the international community’s failure to prevent the occupation from liquidating the Palestinian cause. Our position has been validated because the international community has watched our extermination for a year and has done nothing practical or effective to prevent it. After a year of genocide, we still see Netanyahu speaking at the UN. Therefore, we say that your silence on Netanyahu will create others like him among you, and when that happens the suffering will reach everyone. There is still time for you to take humane and ethical positions that are in your interest as much as they are in ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the free people supporting the liberation of Palestine, the Palestinian people are watching your actions, and we see that you pose a real threat to the occupation. Continue your struggle, continue exposing the occupation, highlighting its crimes, and putting pressure on it and its supporters. Make them outcasts wherever they go, and sever the ties between your governments and the Israeli government. Ensure that your activism becomes more effective because the children of Palestine need your action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t be the first or last to note this, but one characteristic defining this era of political defeat is how feebly solidarity is imagined. The identity documents of countless volunteers tell another story. Sift through the archive of the Palestinian struggle and you will find them. Japanese, French, Norwegians. Bangladeshis, Sudanese. Fighters from all over the world, who made their way to Palestine, to a besieged Beirut, and defended the inhabitants of refugee camps. People don’t brave perilous routes for hundreds of miles or risk their lives for a goal as ambiguous and vacuous as ‘uplifting’ the voices of the oppressed. They do so because they recognise, as Ghassan Kanafani wrote, that striking one arm of imperialism anywhere is a blow to its collective body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! welcome to october, a time of year where i usually become extra deranged due to the onset of seasonal depression. down in australia spring is arriving which means i am actually feeling pretty hopeful, optimistic, believing in joy again, etc—but not to worry, still deranged as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;due to my agonies (see below), i have been meticulously creating a fanmix. i LOVE making fanmixes, even though i seem to end up recycling the same songs over and over again. is it because i’m simply not good at curation, or because the dynamics and characters i get obsessed with have the same flavour of romance (or, in other words, the same problems and issues)? who can say. anyway here’s some of the Songs Of All Time. to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve got just over a week until hana moves in and my bachelor pad era ends, so i’ve decided that i must finish &lt;em&gt;the sopranos&lt;/em&gt;. i should have made this decision earlier because i’m now attempting to watch 1.5 seasons in 15 days, which means i’m mainlining it at a rate that is unprecedented and, quite frankly, concerning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m currently at the end of season 5, which has been intense. my favourite episode had to be tony’s incredible dream sequence episode, which truly captures how it feels to be a prisoner to your own lunatic subconscious. when he started spitting out bloody teeth into his hand…. i’ve been there babe! what i like so much about these dreams is that they reveal so much to us while also being totally nonsensical and confusing. bring back subtlety in tv shows! it’s something the sopranos is so good at: leaving the viewer to form our own conclusions, drawing out these careful nuances in the way the characters think or act. we see carmela wrestling with her separation from tony, weeping on the phone when meadow announces her engagement, trying to divorce him once and for all but every time she tries to leave something makes her think twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in general the theme of season 5 seems to be lack of escape routes. we see tony b trying to make it as an honest man, training to be a massage therapist and opening a massage parlour, but drawn back into the mob after a shocking scene where he realises how much an honest life costs, and beats his new partner bloody. he gets involved with the new york mafia’s power struggle following the death of their boss, and from then on we know the course this takes. there’s carmela, trying to divorce tony but coming up against the power and fear he instils in every divorce lawyer in new jersey—in the end she has no choice but to let him back in. even though it might seem like her own decision, it’s not, really. and of course, adriana. her death felt inevitable from the moment she started working with the fbi, but i still found the moment itself shocking: betrayed by christopher, crawling through the woods begging for mercy as silvio coldly shoots her dead. woof. adriana’s downfall was believing that christopher would choose her over tony; underestimating the complex ties of love and hate that bind the mafia men together. christopher has been doomed to this since becoming a made man. no matter how cruel tony is to him, he can’t extricate himself. it’s greed, yes, a desire for power, but it’s something more than that, something that supersedes all else: duty. a sense of beholdenness to these men who have raised him in their image. and yet we know all too well that anyone can be disposed of, that nobody is safe from a gunshot in the night and a dumping of your body where nobody can find you; or a big funeral where the men who murdered you stand in their black suits shoulder-to-shoulder with the other mourners. hypocritical, sure, but this is the fiction that sustains the life that’s all they know. there is no way out except one, and if it happens to you, you had it coming. and everyone else will believe whatever lie they’re told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on marisa’s recommendation i watched &lt;em&gt;fargo&lt;/em&gt; season 5! and wow, what a tv show. i especially loved going on the reddit episode-by-episode forums—it’s so nice to see people enthusiastically dissecting and commenting on every episode. from the very first episode i could tell that fargo is a show that concerns itself with detail, simply because of the redditors going through every line of dialogue, every event, every prop with a fine-toothed comb, looking for significance. you only get fans doing that if you’ve proven time and time again that details matter and that thought goes into every aspect of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our main character is dot, a seemingly ordinary minnesotan woman living with her devoted husband wayne and daughter scotty, but who has a terrible past she’s escaped from that nobody in her new life knows about. she was once married to sheriff roy tilman (we later find out that roy coerced dot into this when she was very young), which was a physically and emotionally abusive situation. in episode 1, sheriff roy finds out dot’s whereabouts and sends hitmen to get her and bring her back—as his wife, she is his property. dot fights back tooth and nail, defeating one of the hitmen in a genuinely heart-racing scene in a gas station in the middle of nowhere, but the other one escapes. dot returns home to pretend that nothing has happened, even though her concerned husband has called the police after dot going missing and signs of a violent, bloody struggle in their home. dot refuses to co-operate: she knows all too well how justice is dispensed in these areas of the country, where roy is essentially able to act with impunity. other characters of note are gator, roy’s son from his first marriage (before dot), a nasty piece of work but one who has been deeply traumatised by his father’s violence; indira, the police officer tasked with investigating dot and being stonewalled at every turn, living in debt with a useless manbaby husband; witt farr, the state trooper attacked by the hitmen during their attempted kidnapping of dot, who develops a fierce care for dot; and lorraine, dot’s mother-in-law, a gun-toting republican billionaire reminiscent of lucille bluth (“snickers for breakfast? are we on welfare?”) the character work is masterful. although there is undoubtedly an irredeemable villain at the heart of the show (roy), the show favours nuance. lorraine starts out suspicious and snooty towards dot, as the nothing girl who entrapped her son, but grows to respect and care for her as the season plays out. indira is a pushover, but we see her stand up for herself and finally quit the policing job that brings her no joy or satisfaction. gator is horrific, but scenes between him and dot show that he’s suffered at his father’s hands too, and dot’s compassion towards him reminds us that once he was a small boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the soundtrack is fantastic, the acting is superb, and it has moments of real humour and levity. i’m ready for the other seasons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;imagine me rolling my sleeves up. okay. so over the last couple of weeks i have fallen into an obsessive hole that can only be explained by “a lack of romance in my life” (thanks to my therapist for that one)—i’ve been inhaling romance novels at an alarming speed. gay ones, not straight ones, needless to say: i’m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; desperate. the series that has really burrowed its way into my mind is &lt;em&gt;the will darling adventures&lt;/em&gt; by kj charles: a post-wwi romance between an ex-soldier from the trenches / bookstore owner / proletarian loverboy and a “bag of nerves and attitudes” / upperclass nervous greyhound / secret agent. look, i know. what makes it even worse is that the non-romance plot of the first book and some of the second is extremely anti-bolshevik for some ludicrous reason. which, if you know me at all, means this is possibly the highest endorsement that i can make: i don’t give a fuck about the politics, because the romance plotline of these books is &lt;em&gt;so insanely good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i actually don’t know where to start this or what to say beyond READ THEM and “i feel so crazy it is making me want to bite my thumbs off”. the story kicks off with will darling, recently demobbed from wwi and therefore at a loose end (to put it mildly), being left in charge of his recently-deceased uncle’s used bookshop, when he’s abruptly threatened by two very different people in search of something secret buried within the bookshop. and then in walks kim secretan, seemingly offering help, but in fact about to double cross, lie and steal from will. their meeting ignites an insane physical chemistry that develops into a profound obsession with one another. and despite will soon realising that kim has been lying to his face, he can’t seem to stay away. the war has opened up this wild streak in him that yearns for adventure, for a good solid fight, for a devious queer who brings violence to his door. kim, on the other hand, is three hundred self-esteem issues stacked up inside a trench coat, and he desperately hates himself for tricking will. he doesn’t believe he’s good enough for the care and generous tenderness will is offering. and yet… he also can’t bring himself to stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“a decent man debased” is how will describes kim, and as things progress, he sees more and more of that decency in kim, the honourable core at his heart. how fiercely he’ll fight for the people he cares about, while believing himself so wretched as to not deserve their respect or love. &lt;em&gt;well, fuck that&lt;/em&gt;, is what will says, and refuses to let kim walk away from him. over and over again, he constantly demands of kim to treat him better, to be better, because that’s what they both deserve. and kim rises to the challenge every time. underlying this are several power disparities: kim is educated, wealthy, self-possessed, while will is none of those things, and frequently feels on the back foot, particularly as kim shuts him out with his lies and deception. meanwhile, will has his own baggage to lay at kim’s feet: namely that he spent four years living through hell in the trenches, he’d rather lie down and die than accept help from anyone, and he can’t bring himself to conceive of a future or a way to speak about his feelings and desires, unless they’re in bed and he can let the physical attraction do the talking. slowly, inexorably, they both change. will refuses to let kim punish himself; kim pulls will out of his dark places and gives him a safe place to be vulnerable. together, they find a pathway to the future. to be loved is to be changed!!! to be loved is to be seen, wholly and fully. to have your flaws laid out on the table and have someone say: you’re better than this and i know it, but i’ll take everything you have been as long as you promise to live up to the man i know you are. and through their deep understanding of one another, they come to a greater self-understanding too. in my opinion? there’s nothing more romantic than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we always knew that the Zionist entity didn’t finish the job in 1948.  We understand the Zionist mentality.  That’s one of our biggest problems.  Understanding that mentality means acknowledging a kind of logic beyond the emotional capacity of functional human beings, a logic that invariably leads to our own demise.  Knowing Zionism, as we’ve been made to do, is an incessant suicide mission.  They were always going to try to finish the job, with or without an October 7.  They were finishing the job all along.  Every Palestinian life, every Palestinian expression of being, was an unfinished mission.  Palestinians were being exterminated as a matter of course, like infrastructure updates or budget approvals.  There is no other option available to those who hold onto the idea of Israel.  We knew it.  Even if some of our comrades thought that we were too delusional, too zealous, too uncompromising—that deep in our hearts we were hateful and fanatical, as the Oriental is apt to be—we knew.  That’s all.  Some of us fought on behalf of softness, with voting rituals, NGO activism, critical theory, all the stuff that offers a civilized façade.  But now we have no choice:  the Zionists validated our knowledge.  Hardness is the only viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can declare without much ambiguity that I support armed resistance to colonization, I recognize it as an abstract declaration.  Am I willing to take up a gun and get shot at?  It’s impossible to say without being forced into the decision.  That’s the thing about resistance:  people are forced into it.  In the end the choice I would make doesn’t matter, because if I ever find myself with a gun and getting shot at then it’s not necessarily something I would have chosen.  I would be reacting to material circumstances, not to distant and disembodied questions of moral propriety.  People need to remember that about Palestinian fighters:  resistance is a necessity forced onto them by settler colonization.  If a people’s survival depends upon militancy, then that people will become militant.  Both North and South are littered with examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know and nobody told me and what&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;could I do or say, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I did know it was the money I earned as a poet that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paid for the bombs and the planes and the tanks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that they used to massacre your family&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sobering moment is a turning point in the long regional war for liberation from racist, Western-backed settler-colonial Zionism. But after a century of Zionism’s depredations and horrors, neither the people of Lebanon nor Palestine have surrendered, and there’s no reason to believe they will now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, after the initial shock, the determination of the resistance will only increase, and its circle will expand, as it has in every phase of the liberation struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! usually i love the feeling that comes with september but my internal clock has been thrown out by this move and the change of hemisphere and the brutal tossing of my fragile body back into winter and consequently i have no idea what time of year it is. spring is coming i guess? rumour has it? but for those of you back in the northern hemisphere, i hope the nights aren’t drawing in too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the yaoi gods have got me, as happens about twice a year on average, where my brain gets offered up as some kind of sacrificial lamb for them to feast on. this time it’s the fantasy series &lt;em&gt;the cemeteries of amalo&lt;/em&gt;, following the adventures of thara celehar, a gay elf priest who can speak to the dead. please stay with me. don’t scroll away. along the way he meets a half-goblin opera composer, iäna pel-thenhior, and, you guessed it, they have been sending me bonkers bananas insane. it’s really quite bad for me out here, not least because 1) all they do over two whole entire novels is (barely) hold hands. BARELY!! and 2) this series is so obscure that there are a mere 60 works on ao3 for them (by contrast, there are 43,825 works for lan wangji and wei wuxian from the untamed). this is bad news for all of you, too, because my crazy’s got to go somewhere and that somewhere is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the cemeteries of amalo&lt;/em&gt; is a follow-up series to &lt;em&gt;the goblin emperor&lt;/em&gt;, in which we meet celehar for the first time. he is a witness for the dead, who are priests of the god ulis with the unique power to communicate with dead people’s spirits shortly after they die. at the beginning of the story he has renounced his prelacy for mysterious and unknown reasons (spoiler alert: they’re gay ones) and is residing at court on the charity of his cousin, meaning he’s conveniently on hand for the new emperor, maia, to call on to investigate the untimely deaths of the previous emperor and his sons. when maia meets celehar, he immediately realises that something is incredibly wrong with this man, and we soon find out what it is: in his previous position, he fell in love with a married man. the marriage was deeply unhappy and there were no recourses to help celehar’s lover, and so he turned to murder, killing his wife. but the body was found, and celehar asked to witness for her to find out who did it. he couldn’t lie, and so his lover was convicted for the death of his wife, and beheaded. yikes, to say the least. anyway, through witnessing for maia’s father, he gains back his confidence in his calling and, although he’s offered a place in maia’s household, he decides to go off and work as a witness for the dead once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;book 1 of the follow-up series, &lt;em&gt;the witness for the dead&lt;/em&gt;, finds celehar in amalo, depressed as ever. he is called to investigate the murder of an unknown woman, whom he realises is an opera singer. to the opera, then! where he meets flamboyant, gaudy (in his own words), fiery-tempered iäna pel-thenhior, the principal director of the opera and its composer. after their first meeting, this crops up in celehar’s narration: “He strode away, leaving me for a moment off balance, as if the force of his personality had been holding me upright.” okay lol…….i know what you are………&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the book goes on, iäna offering his help for celehar’s investigation and celehar accepting it, coming to and from the opera to interview suspects, getting iäna to help him clear out the victim’s room, go hunting for information in her usual haunts across the city, etc. i should also point out that celehar’s narration is a hellscape. he is incredibly lacking in self-esteem, doesn’t believe he deserves to be happy, an insomniac, and tormented by memories of evru, his lover whom he convicted to death. AND YET. even through this incredibly biased lens (his own thoughts), we see how kind he is, how honest, how principled. people trust him, not only with their dead, but themselves: their secrets, their grief, their hopes and fears. they care for him, because he is a person worth caring for, even if he doesn’t think that about himself. iäna pel-thenhior recognises this from the start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you not afraid I will use that truth against you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stopped and considered me for a moment, then said, “No. You are honest and you serve Ulis faithfully. If you were merely looking for a convenient person to blame, you wouldn’t have made it as far as the Vermilion Opera in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are wagering rather a lot on your reading of my character.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t a wager,” said Pel-Thenhior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;devastatingly romantic. to ME! i will spare you all a full recounting of the novel’s events, but the scene that sends me the most insane is one where iäna and celehar have been out investigating, and iäna takes him to dinner….at his MOTHER’S RESTAURANT. where obviously his mother comes out and fusses over them and is delighted that celehar can speak a little of the goblin language and tells iäna: “i like this one, don’t scare him away.” you can’t see me as i type this but i’m smiling like an idiot. GOD. GAY PEOPLE!!! this experience (going on a date) causes celehar to have a panic attack afterwards, because he’s so terrified to love again. i won’t say i’ve been there because that would cheapen his very real trauma but i feel it’s a sentiment that we can all relate to on some level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at the end of the book, celehar solves the mystery and takes iäna out for tea, where iäna tells him, “you can come use my box at the opera* any time you like”. (*where i will obviously be every night because i am the principal director) like…………………….okay. cool. i feel fine and normal about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you guys see why this is driving me feral yet? here’s book 2: &lt;em&gt;the grief of stones&lt;/em&gt;. iäna is not immediately involved in this book’s mysteries but that doesn’t stop celehar from going to the opera to hang out with him (“I was being a fool and I knew it”). and the next night too (“Two nights in a row?” he said as he waved me to the second chair at his small table. I knew I was blushing again). like. guys!!! and celehar keeps going back, always under the pretext of “asking advice” or “telling him about the case” but to the discerning reader, it is very obvious what is going on. it is also obvious to the entire cast and working staff of the opera, who recognise celehar and greet him cheerily every time he interrupts a rehearsal/arrives late to slink into the box in the middle of the performance/turns up to their after-work drinks/etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;during the course of the investigation, celehar has to battle a very powerful dead spirit, which leaves him wounded and unable to speak to the dead. he goes to the opera (of course) to see iäna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i must side-note again to explain that this world has elaborate grammar conventions for formality: &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; for first-person formal, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; for first-person informal, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; for second-person formal and &lt;em&gt;thee/thou/thy&lt;/em&gt; for third-person informal. so far celehar and iäna have exclusively used I and you with one another, which tends to be the case amongst normal people addressing each other—unless you are intimate in some way. you can see where i’m going with this, i hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so celehar expresses that he’s lost his powers, and in this moment of vulnerability and pain and suffering, iäna says, defiantly (defiantly!!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would be of comfort to thee if I could.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so startled at being thee’d I could barely speak. “Th … thou wouldst?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Needst not sound so shocked,” he said, rather wryly. “I did not think that my regard for thee was any particular secret.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;excuse me, i need a moment to compose myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, so that was fucking crazy, right? right??? lord above. they talk more, celehar refuses iäna’s offer of company (!) at night (!!!) to help him with his bad dreams (!!!), and goes home to muse on not being sure what iäna wants: “simple companionship or something more”. girl, if i SLAP….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;celehar solves the mystery again, everything ties up apart from this pesky business of losing his ability to speak to the dead, aka his entire identity and also his job and reason for being in this city. he is convinced by a friend to write to the archprelate (his big boss) to ask to stay in amalo (and every time celehar thinks about staying he also thinks about….you guessed it….iäna). and then celehar goes to the opera to tell iäna about the investigation and this happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hesitated. “Art thou any better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I hear the dead, dost mean? No. There is no change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What wilt thou do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is for the Archprelate to decide. I have written to him, but I do not know when I will hear back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And yet thou’rt still sane! I’m not sure I would be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes insanity is tempting,” I admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dark, Iäna’s hand found mine, and we sat for a while in silence, until I dredged together enough fortitude to say, “I am keeping thee from thy rehearsal. I should go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As long as thou com’st back,” said Iäna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;shaking crying screaming throwing up. tearing my hair out. RENDING my GARMENTS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i finished &lt;em&gt;house of the dragon&lt;/em&gt; season 2. let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE GOOD: rhaenyra really comes into her own this season. loved every scene with her and jace (who i kind of fancy, no further questions at this time). LOVED her alliance with mysaria. i found mysaria initially so boring and dull and then in episode six the penny finally dropped and i was like OH, she’s a lesbian. not only am i on board, i’m driving the damn train myself. the episode 4 battle was sick. princess rhaenys i would follow you into battle anywhere. really enjoyed the finding-new-dragonriders arc!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE BAD: pacing was utterly terrible, and character work is distinctly lacking. i need someone to sit me down like i’m a child and explain otto hightower’s motivations to me in this season. WHY would he want aegon on the throne? the only good reason to do that would be to shaft rhaenyra, and tbqh it’s also not exactly clear why he didn’t ally himself to her and try to work with her, years before. the whole “i don’t think the realm will get behind a woman” line just doesn’t feel good enough, especially when he lets alicent basically rule for viserys during his illness. so then does he just want his own blood on the throne? he doesn’t seem stupid or cutthroat enough for that. it also takes away a lot of agency from alicent to have him be the driving force behind putting aegon on the throne; but then i guess they needed to give her a “way out” for all the back-and-forths she has with rhaenyra later on. idk i get that the homoerotic best friends-to-enemies dynamic between rhaenicent is what the showrunners are trying to push as the heart of this war, but it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; land to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and don’t even get me started on daemon and what an incredibly chaotic character he is, i don’t even have the energy to get into his 500 personality changes and opaque motivations. being imprisoned in his mind palace of delusion every single episode was an act of violence towards me personally. each time i would start an episode and think, &lt;em&gt;please for the love of god make daemon’s hallucinations be over&lt;/em&gt; and the show would be like, &lt;em&gt;nope! here’s an extended scene of him fucking his mum, enjoy xx&lt;/em&gt; i actually left the room during the one where he’s watching viserys mourning aemma and went to brush my teeth, wash my face etc. came back and it was STILL going on. intensely boring and lazy storytelling, imo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also, i could have told you without watching that HBO doesn’t have the range or the inclination to do a revolution storyline properly; i really didn’t need to have “there are good kings and bad kings and good kings take care of their people!” rammed down my throat for an entire season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally can someone PLEASE teach the showrunners how to write a joke? please….just one moment of levity……it’s all i ask……&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE UGLY: please for the love of god someone get the velaryons some better wigs. to quote arenike, they look like mops that have been draped over their heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MINDNUMBINGLY DULL: oh my god, all the table chat that kept going round and round in circles. we get it, men are misogynists and warmongers and don’t listen to women! we don’t need 5 scenes of exactly the same stuff! they’re trying to replicate the intense political manouevrings that we loved in &lt;em&gt;game of thrones&lt;/em&gt; but there just isn’t enough substance or heft to these scenes to make them intriguing or tense or interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL: aemond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hi, hello. a few people asked me whether i was planning to continue this substack while i’m in australia and the answer is you can’t get rid of me that easily! life is very overwhelming and my brain is in a constant state of adapting and adjusting to all the confusing things that are happening, but i’m trying to carve out time amidst all of that for my favourite activities: obsessing over things and sharing my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s time to talk about kim namjoon. his latest release is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/512dQp7hBbDDurodCqSw5I?si=EENwQfosQuOVHGA3FYESWw&quot;&gt;right place, wrong person&lt;/a&gt; and guys, he has done it again: created a piece of art. i’ve written before about his first album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/2wGinO7YWLHN2sULIr4a7v?si=bt_K14WwTGiV2ok5_WOMAw&quot;&gt;indigo&lt;/a&gt;, and how vulnerable it was. rpwp is no less vulnerable, but it marks a distinct shift in emotional landscape. if indigo was, &lt;em&gt;here is my beating heart on a platter and it is furiously searching for a way to keep on living&lt;/em&gt; then rpwp is &lt;em&gt;I LIVED BITCH!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;listening to indigo, i got the sense that namjoon is asking for something—a chance to live, permission to keep on trying. rpwp isn’t asking anymore. the project has a sense of urgency about it—namjoon delayed his military service to work on the album, and it reflects that, i think. it’s something that &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to exist so he could find peace. the kind of art you make when you’re trying to find your way back to yourself, when you’re wandering far from your friends and unsure where your tethers are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like indigo, it has fantastic features: little simz and moses sumney! and like indigo it’s clear how much thought and consideration has gone into the construction of the album: its musicality, its instrumentation, its experimentation with genre. it feels &lt;em&gt;fun,&lt;/em&gt; like namjoon is finally not holding back, finally throwing off the burden that has been weighing him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s unapologetic and unafraid. it’s a cigarette lit and thrown on a pyre, an angry fuck you to anyone who’s ever tried to box him in. it’s all of namjoon’s contractictions bound up in one piece of work. and what a brave and bold and beautiful gift that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;side note: jimin and namjoon doing a listen-through of the album together ripped me and hayley apart. highly recommend for anyone who wants to watch someone who unconditionally loves another person think about and talk through the art one of them made at a dark time in their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;audrey and i finished young royals season 3! the final episode made me scream, out loud, at least three times and i’ve rewatched the final scene… MANY times. listen… sometimes a tv show gives you everything you want and everything you didn’t think you would get!!! i’ll say it once agan: this show is about honesty and trying to do right by one another. wille and simon are so young. they’re teenagers, shouldering the difficulty of a private relationship made public—at first it was through forces out of their control, but by season three we’re made aware that wille’s role as prince means that their relationship is controlled and scrutinised by everyone from the cute six-year-old boy at the protest who wants a picture with simon, to the palace spin doctors who won’t let simon post on instagram, who want wille to be the poster boy of a cause for his birthday. wille understands the strictures—he was raised inside them—but simon doesn’t, and hates them. throughout the series we see them make compromises for each other, try their best, and eventually realise that love is not enough. and yet… maybe it is enough. maybe you can make a choice that lets you be with the person you love. a choice not for them, but because of them. because of what they’ve taught you and shown you through how they’ve loved you. a choice for yourself. a choice for happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOVE WINS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started house of the dragon, because i miss game of thrones (likely thing for me to do) and yet wanted something new. plus i saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/lonelyvampx/757761235042353152/house-of-the-dragon-modern-au&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; clip of the cast and thought, i need to watch this. i love when a cast bands together to bully the himbo. anyway, after episode one i immediately opened a wiki of ice and fire to clarify a few things—we’re so fucking back. matthew warned me about the “traumatic birthing scenes” in season 1 and he was not wrong. episode one kicks us off with a bang: king viserys opting to slice his wife open to retrieve the unborn child because he’s so obsessed with having a son, and subsequently watching her bleed out on the bed. a caesarian!!! with no medical equipment and no anaesthetic??? horrific. horrendous. lock that man up. anyway, apart from finding matt smith deeply unconvincing as the sexy rogue dragonlord prince daemon targaryen and being distracted by the truly appalling quality of some of the wigs, i’m having a good time! i am wary of saying who my favourites are because as we know, everything can change in an instant. i’m hoping for good, solid character development, motivations that make sense and a lot of beautiful gowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i downloaded &lt;em&gt;percy jackson and the lightning thief&lt;/em&gt; onto my ereader yesterday because i am 10,000 miles from home and under a lot of stress. no further questions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last seen (theatre)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;elete and i went to see Mother (sarah snook) in &lt;em&gt;the picture of dorian grey&lt;/em&gt;, which was an incredible experience. i had no idea what to expect, to the extent where i didn’t realise it was a one-woman play. sarah snook plays every character, donning an impressive array of wigs and costumes and accents to be everyone from the fruitily evil lord henry to the depressive basil, artist of the eponymous portrait, to silly, innocent sybil vane and her brother james, obsessed with revenge. she also narrates the script, based heavily on the text of the book. oh it was so good guys!!! she is completely magnetic, inhabiting every character so fully and switching between personas at the drop of the hat. dorian himself is an incredible piece of acting, changing from wide-eyed ingenue to wicked hedonist over the course of the play. the staging was inventive and exciting too—i could have sat there and watched sarah snook standing against a blank backdrop doing the entire thing, but the way that the filming and effects were done was so clever. it enhanced the experience rather than overwhelming you, apart from one section where dorian enters an opium den-slash-techno club, where the overwhelm felt intentional. 10 stars! standing ovation! sarah snook should play every character in every novel! do dickens next, queen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;currently watching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;young royals is back! my boys are back! and audrey and i are seated, of course. season three opens with wille and simon, now happily and openly in a relationship, navigating their new status as out at school and out to his family. simon is receiving hate messages online, which breaks my heart, while wille is struggling with what it means that he is now a Prince With A Consort. meanwhile, sara reaches out to her estranged dad because she’s lost all her friends due to sleeping with august (evil man!!) and felice is depressed because she misses sara but is also angry with her, which she immediately confesses to wille and simon (audrey: i love how they talk about their emotions / me: they’re SO emotionally literate) imagine being a teenager and openly communicating what’s on your mind. incredible. anyway i’m obviously having a fantastic time. wille/simon forever!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;under duress (iman texting me about 300 times “when are you going to watch bridgerton?”), i have been watching bridgerton season 2, probably the most stupid television show i’ve ever seen and that is saying something. my mum raised me to be a republican and yet here i am watching these lords and ladies caper about in the most absurd american fantasy of british gentry. embarrazzing! anyway, i have to admit that i enjoy the way some of the actors absolutely relish their roles (lady danbury is eating!) and particularly the anachronistic phrases which hana and i can’t stop quoting at each other (“you CANNOT be in earnest” / “i shall see you there anon” / “we wish to discuss more intellective matters”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my life has been completely taken over by &lt;em&gt;the murderbot diaries,&lt;/em&gt; a seven-book series about a robot-human construct that disables its governor module that controls its behaviour—and spends its newfound freedom half-assing its job and watching copious amounts of TV because it’s depressed and anxious. relatable, some might say!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my biggest gripe with the vast majority of SFF is that there is no humour in the books. i’m not saying they have to be laugh out loud funny, but i would like a little lightness, a touch of the droll perhaps. instead we get reams of dry (or purple!) prose with not a joke in sight. it bores me! so i absolutely ate up murderbot’s dry witticisms and snappy internal monologue. i also loved the tightness of the plots. the first four books are novellas, each with a central mystery arc/problem that resolves itself while also giving murderbot time and space for character development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the character development is the heart of the series. murderbot is a SecurityUnit, considered to be a piece of equipment by the company that owns it. the company leases it out as security protection for teams on mining installations, surveyors of planets, etc. the governor module is meant to keep it in check, preventing it from doing anything outside of its contract—it will even fry the SecUnit’s brain if it strays too far from its contracted humans. when murderbot liberates itself from the module, it continues doing its job, while spending much of its processing time secretly watching media. because when you’ve never had free will, trying to decide what you want to do is difficult. it’s the question that follows murderbot through the series, as it explores its past, tries to help humans where it can, and slowly builds connections with others. it learns about having emotions, letting people in, telling them what is on your mind. it learns to make friends, and learns that its care and protection can be reciprocated. the best relationship is its one with the consciousness running a big research ship that murderbot calls ART (Asshole Research Transport)—this too is yuri!! i loved it all, honestly. i’m so sad that i’ve run out of books in the series, because murderbot is the kind of character i can never get enough of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free palestine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02690055.2024.2315734&quot;&gt;the prison as a text&lt;/a&gt; by layan kayed (trans. roba alsalibi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prison wants to isolate you from your people and your homeland, just as it wants to estrange you from your dream of believing ‘imprisonment’ to be the resort of dreamers. It likewise wants to alienate you from fellow prisoners and their legacy by claiming that the withdrawal of any privilege is the result of other prisoners’ misuse of it. But you, enormously grateful, know that without the years of struggle and sacrifice, prison life would have never been bearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/up-in-arms&quot;&gt;up in arms&lt;/a&gt; by austin bilal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, beneath the veneer of innovation and economic contribution lies the reality that arms companies are dependent on imperialism; the arms industry is geared to reap great profits from the inherent tendency towards war and military conflict within a world system of uneven exchange, and so their role in the education system is to reproduce the ideological basis for its perpetuation. As an extension of US imperial power in the region, Israel is the recipient of billions of dollars worth of arms. One wonders without such military aid and investment from Western states, whether their settler-colonial project would last a minute longer against the Palestinian resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/icc-warrants-both-historic-and-cynical&quot;&gt;ICC warrants both historical and cynical&lt;/a&gt; by ali abunimah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Khan can attempt to market all this as demonstrating equal justice, it is no such thing: It is an outrageous and false equivalence. He could not maintain a shred of credibility if he did nothing against Israeli leaders, so he did the minimum he thought he could get away with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this will also be of no surprise to anyone, least of all Hamas leaders, who would have expected to be charged as the price of obtaining some measure of international justice for their people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/a-productive-language&quot;&gt;‘a productive language’: on western intellectual paradigms and refaat al-areer&lt;/a&gt; by ameed faleh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mikhail advocated for Palestinian intellectuals to reject material incentives, joining hands with the displaced masses for liberation, a sentiment shared by V.I. Lenin who rejected the stratum of intelligentsia that rejected their historical duty towards the land and the people. For both Mikhail and Lenin, the intelligentsia has the ability to put theory into practice and to use their knowledge for the betterment of mankind, and any role outside of this is simply rejected out of revolutionary necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being a birthday GIRL! with elete on may 7th. hana making bibimbap and the honey roast afterwards that made everyone weep. ethiopian food at my favourite place in tottenham with alex, lydia and dorothy. lydia: “last year you had no beer and no girlfriend…how far you’ve come”. seeing kandinsky with alfie and sitting on the southbank in the sun afterwards. meeting chloe’s kitten and playing magic the gathering with her and hector. dofu gan and garlic chives with siyang. getting prescription sunglasses (life-changing). drinks with hana, ash and reb (our children). watching dorothy run in the hackney half! climbing with hana. iman texting me old pictures of us as babies. brunch with lola. audrey making shakshuka. arenike in the sun. crying because i am so proud of her and us! making spiced lamb and aubergine from the ixta belfrage cookbook lydia got me. my first conference presentation, and alice and ed coming to support me. hanging out with zoë in boston and cooking scallion pancakes together. bagels in the sun. big bright tulips. seeing a turkey (terrifying) in the park. zoë’s oatmeal. sitting outside at new river with abeera and leena. irises blooming in the community garden beside the river lea. the smell of roses in the rain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spacesweepers.tumblr.com/post/744900584782561280/in-king-lear-iiivii-there-is-a-man-who-is-such&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; quote from cs lewis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://queenlua.tumblr.com/post/747710885066358784/the-heron-by-paul-farley&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by paul farley. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/ololygas/679456160953352192/linda-gregg&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; linda gregg poem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://firstfullmoon.tumblr.com/post/741827801521487872/p%C3%A1draig-%C3%B3-tuama-the-lifeline&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; pádraig ó tuama poem. &amp;amp; finally: celebrating my phd being done and honouring my beautiful friends in the acknowledgements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello. january felt particularly long and brutal this year, so absolutely good riddance to that, although the grey dreariness of february isn’t much comfort. as we head into the end of the lunar year, i’m feeling sad to let the year of the rabbit go. i wrote last year: &lt;em&gt;it’s a year of escaping demons, of running fast and free, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kairisk.tumblr.com/post/707195561572499456/if-they-catch-you-they-will-kill-you-but-first&quot;&gt;being swift and full of tricks&lt;/a&gt;, of becoming ungovernable&lt;/em&gt;, and i think the year reflected that in many different ways. but it’s time to look ahead to the year of the dragon: a year of burning bridges, of flying on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/931-i-do-not-care-what-comes-after-i-have-seen&quot;&gt;the winds of morning&lt;/a&gt;, of myth and magic, of building a big hoard and keeping it safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hana and i went to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66VvbxyEmHU&quot;&gt;life unrehearsed&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary about two old korean lesbians (kim insun and lee soohyun) and their life together in berlin. i literally cried through the entire film, right from the opening scene which shows a photograph of the two of them holding hands in a park. it’s a beautiful, tender, moving depiction of the joy and tenderness in their relationship. the film doesn’t shy away from the difficulties they’ve gone through, but it’s principally concerned with showing how much they love each other and how happy and secure their life together is. there are so many beautiful touches of domesticity, mixed with scenes showing the two of them at various protests: insun speaks at a demonstration for nurses of colour, and soohyun goes along to a renters protest to bang her drum and chant &lt;em&gt;enough is enough&lt;/em&gt;. it was so incredibly moving to me to see how their life contains both struggle and joy, how much strength they give to each other, and how honest and tender their love is. god! i love lesbians! i love old asian women! i love love!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of my favourite sequences was watching soohyun make/mend a rainbow shawl for insun (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C2Zqy4sLa0X/&quot;&gt;look at her&lt;/a&gt; wearing it. oh my god) when it’s finished, insun wraps herself in it and dances around the room. fondly, soohyun says, “how old are you?!” and insun retorts, beaming, “love has no age!” we next see insun packing for a trip to korea. when she gets to seoul, she constructs a cross out of wood (both insun and soohyun are christian) and wraps it in the shawl. she writes a sign that says, &lt;em&gt;god loves all of us — kim insun&lt;/em&gt; and takes the cross to seoul pride. on her way there she cheekily says, “everyone’s looking at me!” to the cameraperson. she walks past police officers, homophobic religious protestors, and joins the celebration, dancing with young people, waving a light-up star wand and doing interviews. back in berlin, soohyun goes to berlin pride alone. she takes a photo with drag queens, gets emotional seeing the front of the protest being reserved for those with disabilities. the documentary maker asks her, “why don’t you and insun show much affection in public?” and soohyun responds that she gets anxious about people showing them hate or disrespect because of it; so they don’t often hold hands in public. the next day, insun comes along to the parade with soohyun, and we see them holding hands in the midst of it all. what an absolute privilege to be let into their lives for a brief moment. feel very grateful to have seen this documentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after weeks of everyone in my life telling me i needed to watch the traitors, i finally sat down and watched all of season one in about the space of a week. what a fantastic show full of the most absurd characters. truly a perfect distillation of the british public at large: bigoted, easily deceived, bland, mediocre at best and actively evil at worst. with notable exceptions, of course—love you andrea, love you faye, love you amos. starting season 2 was a very funny contrast—these people are a whole different kettle of fish. we’ve still got our bigots and our bland kings and queens, but we also have people who are absolutely out for blood. their eyes are giving evil. i can’t wait! currently praying for paul’s downfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i hit a reading slump towards the end of january, partly because i’m actually forcing myself to stop buying physical copies of books (on that note, if anyone has any books i can borrow, let me know) and partly because i desperately just want to read A Good Book and i kept reading contemporary literary fiction books that were, tbqh, deeply mid. i’m making a pivot now to go through the pulitzer prize winners from the 90s and see how they treat me. currently i’m on &lt;em&gt;the stone diaries&lt;/em&gt; by carol shields, which chronicles the life of daisy stone goodwill, growing up first in manitoba and then in indiana in the early 20th century, and the various characters that populate her existence as she gets older, marries, has children. the latent potential of books like this lies in whether they can take the particular and open it up to the general; if they manage to make us see something of ourselves in a story that is so deeply focused on the minutiae of someone else’s life. if the author gets it right, it’s genius. if they get it wrong, it can be very, very boring. we’ll see how it goes!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making wontons with martha and hana. trying to explain to hana why we find shaun evans (endeavour morse) so sexy. nandini’s chicken fesejan, eaten with jun and arenike in her beautiful rent-free holborn flat. talking about growth and how long we’ve known each other. the finsbury park wine bar man telling me and hana, “i know” when we said we’d been there before. finally framing my prints and putting them up on my wall. reading rob macfarlane’s &lt;em&gt;the old ways&lt;/em&gt; with zoë. swimming in the olympic pool with alfie. bumping into my mum at the palestine march. lola’s birthday dinner in south london gallery. cooking ixta belfrage’s aubergine with lime yoghurt and cinnamon tomato chilli oil. sri lankan food with arenike. my dad’s 60th birthday meal. small plates at forza wine bar (plus a free limoncello shot). seeing grieg’s piano concerto live with hana. the hilariously pretentious german men sat behind us. being a hater in waterstones with arenike. msc writing group and hanging out with plume, the world’s silliest cat. sitting in the pub for hours with alex, lydia, saskia and dorothy. henry cooking delicious food for me and claire. claire saying, “we should have a friendship wedding”. walking in hyde park with shahla. reading micha’s beautiful brilliant book. meeting tamsyn muir and gesticulating wildly as i tried to articulate how harrow the ninth is a work of genius. watching the full moon rise on the sea in margate. smoked prawns. scorched mackerel. cured trout. sourdough. orange wine. a long walk on the beach. filling our lungs with fresh sea air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that’s all from me. take care out there. spring is on the way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello loves. here we are at the end of the year. it feels impossible to write any kind of summary of [gestures broadly] whatever the fuck that was, so instead i want to take this moment to say: thank you for reading this newsletter, for keeping me company through 2023. i wish you love, light, and so many moments of joy in the year to come. and as always: free palestine.&lt;/p&gt;

ATEEZ came back with a new album on december 1st ready to save me from seasonal depression and it, as per usual, slaps. i woke up at 5am to watch the music video with zoë and listen to the seonghwa &amp;amp; hongjoong unit song (NO further comment on this.) and promptly passed out again, only to wake up to 100+ messages from zoë as they listened to the album, which i immediately returned as i did a listen of my own. when i got to dreamy day, i said within the first 30 seconds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I LOVE THIS :)&lt;br&gt;
this is miriam coded&lt;br&gt;
MY HANDS ARE IN THE AIRRRRRRR&lt;br&gt;
I LOVE THIS :)&lt;br&gt;
I LOVE THIS!!! :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what more can i say! it’s a song to lift the spirit! &lt;em&gt;whoah-oh-oh, sing it all together&lt;/em&gt;! i love boyband music! unapologetically and with my full heart!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;elete, lee and i took a winter solstice trip to avebury, home of britain’s largest stone circle, built over 4000 years ago. it’s a huge dirt bank (a henge) enclosing large standing stones in a ring, with two smaller rings inside. some of the stones are gone, but what remains is astonishing. they are all different, weathered and eroded into shapes, some smooth, some rough, some with cavities and holes in. there’s something irresistible about them: as soon as we walked up to the first stones we reached out to touch, to hold, to rest against them. we walked up on the bank and had lunch (soup from a thermos for me!) and then wandered around the rest of the circle. after that we walked along a little, fast-flowing river, across muddy fields, bare and bleak, under a dramatic sky to silbury hill, a giant man-made construction of dirt and chalk. nobody knows why silbury hill was built, or what its purpose was. as we crossed the field to reach it, we noticed a moat of water around it (lee: “next time, we bring a boat!”) and it felt as though we were on a mythical quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love neolithic sites. there is something so powerful and magical about them, a place that has held significance for thousands upon thousands of years, even as their original meaning and use has faded from memory. i love how we can understand a small part of the purpose of a site, especially their alignments with sun/moonrise and the seasonal shifts, even as the bigger picture eludes our grasp. these circles and earthworks exist in a place so far outside of our understanding, and yet something about them still compels us, moves us when we set foot in these ancient sacred places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;elete and lee questing by silbury hill, 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
after silbury hill, we walked to west kennett long barrow, a burial site from 3650BC. that was really amazing. we wanted to sit inside the barrow as the sun went down but there was a seance/service going on inside so instead we lay on top and talked about the past year and the one to come. i’ve been struggling to allow myself space to reflect on 2023 in a way that feels honest. by that, i mean: how to acknowledge what a hard, bleak year it’s been whilst also holding the moments up that feel joyful whilst also rejecting a linear narrative of progress (_i hit the bottom of the well but it taught me xyz and now i’m better!_) being on top of the barrow, talking candidly with lee and elete, listening to their honest reflections, helped me to articulate those feelings. as the sun went down on the darkest day of the year, i said to them, _i’ve been really brave this year,_ and they said, _you have_. and that’s enough. 
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you’ve spoken to me about books over the last couple of weeks, you’ll have heard my rant about &lt;em&gt;my work&lt;/em&gt; by olga ravn. the blurb states that it is “a novel about the unique and fundamental experience of motherhood… [exploring] the thorny, twisted ties between pregnancy, maternity, capitalism, work, art, individuality, and literature”. this immediately set alarm bells ringing in my mind. anything that claims to be both unique &amp;amp; fundamental AND look at the links between maternity and capitalism/work had better get it right. i liked olga ravn’s previous novella, &lt;em&gt;the employees&lt;/em&gt;, so much that i thought, okay, let’s give this one a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i should have listened to my misgivings! this was 400 pages of tedious drivel and some of the worst poetry i’ve ever read in my life, with nothing insightful or interesting to say about postnatal depression, the work of motherhood or relations between men and women as parents. it reads as one long complaint about how hard things were for the narrator. i don’t mean to sound callous. i know motherhood is hard, and i know that postpartum depression is a serious illness. my problem was that there was no movement in the book, no progress from one state to another, no development for our narrator. she sits there, complains about giving birth, complains about pregnancy, complains about writing while being a mother, complains about her husband, who can do nothing right—he’s either being too overbearing and trying to be the child’s second mother, or he’s an absent father and a bastard. and that’s supposed to be radical? sorry, but miss me with this. also where were the actual links to politics and political economy? as far as i could tell there was only a brief mention of how the family doesn’t have much money, plus one line misreading marx completely. not to be a bitch but if you have capitalism on the back cover and the book is called My Work, you have to do a little better than that. if you are going to write a book on motherhood and pregnancy and patriarchy in 2023, you need to do a bit of analysis, a bit of digging into why things are the way they are, and what we can do to change it. the endless stasis of the narrator pissed me off!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even worse was the ridiculous section where she starts analysing other works of literature that deal with madness and postnatal depression, citing hiromi ito’s “killing kanoko” as a revolutionary example of defiance. for context, this is a poem about killing a baby called kanoko—the name of hiromi ito’s real life daughter. i have not read it but my brief google showed me the first few lines and they were not nice. in &lt;em&gt;my work&lt;/em&gt;, the narrator says “it’s ridiculous how people think the narrator of ito’s poem is wholly identifiable as her and that she would think about doing harm to her child”. can i stress, the name of ito’s child in real life is kanoko. what the fuck, guys! why is talking openly about wanting to murder your child being portrayed as some sort of heroic feminist act? am i going insane?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;final thing: the number of times the narrator asserted “bad poems are okay” or “writing is allowed to be bad” or “i’m writing a bad book but i don’t care” actually had me laughing by the end. girl… you said it not me….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free palestine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/archive/kanafani/1956/letterfromgaza.htm&quot;&gt;letter from gaza&lt;/a&gt; by ghassan kanafani&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, through these achievements, the Palestinian resistance has been able to present an acute threat to the settler-capitalist property structures called Israel, to militarized accumulation, to the world’s workshop for counterinsurgency technology, and to the entire architecture of regional repression with its associated petrodollar flows, treasury and security purchases, and arms merchandising. For capitalism is not just the smooth clockwork of accumulation through generalized commodity exchange and labor exploitation, it is the machinery of violence – its technology – which ensures the smooth running of the clock, the thingification of its human elements, the political decisions to maintain and rework the machinery of monopoly accumulation, and the waste of human lives which is increasingly the core Arab input into global capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tending—the very act of doctoring—amounts to siding, and Palestinian doctors are killed irrespective of the culpability they’re willing to articulate precisely because to act as a doctor in the face of an exterminatory project is a political act, a presentation of oneself and all the resources they’ve accumulated over decades as a final barrier against death. This, against an occupier committed to necropolitics—total control over the who and when and how of life and death, along with what happens to their bodies after. Through this lens, of course the doctor is a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello. scraping in at the tail end of november with a newsletter. i haven’t really been in the mood for writing, because there are more important things going on than what i’ve been implanting into my brain, but i drafted this last week when i was in bed sick and i wanted to share it. take care of yourselves out there, agitate educate organise, end the occupation, fuck western imperialism, free palestine now and forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve been listening to a lot of johnny flynn lately, as autumn hurtles inexorably towards winter. lee and i went to see him perform his latest album, co-written with rob macfarlane, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/6QHtxviabr2cFMPnPWbp4z?si=TDXD1AJUSIWcaTbXEAYeqA&quot;&gt;the moon also rises&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; this is music for dark nights by a warm fire, for the turning of the seasons, for tramping through a muddy country lane on a crisp cold afternoon. it feels connected to the earth, somehow; elemental. like stories you were told once, long ago, and just about remember. i love johnny flynn’s voice: rough and sweet, expressive, welcoming. there’s a song off the album, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6kzjQCbTdqKX1XlhPAOosa?si=281db847c71d43ed&quot;&gt;burial blessing&lt;/a&gt;, where the refrain goes, &lt;em&gt;be not afraid,&lt;/em&gt; and i’ve been holding onto it like a lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen (concert)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fall out boy: band of my heart, band of my life. i remember seeing them for the first time in 2013, skipping school so i could go queue in the cold outside a tiny venue in islington right after they ended their hiatus. fast forward ten years exactly and i’m once again queueing in the cold to see them live with alfie and siyang. baby seasons change but people don’t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as a teenager, it blew my mind to hear someone rip out their guts and set them to music. i resonated so deeply with the unguarded emotions expressed in pete’s lyrics: the pain and anger and joy. now that i’m twenty-six, i have a better understanding of the experiences pete was writing about; i’ve shared some of them. listening to, say, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/3DASPeFJXSIycNpbROhrAC?si=e87e24b2fab74233&quot;&gt;i’ve got a dark alley and a bad idea that says you should shut your mouth&lt;/a&gt; hits a little different now. the refrain in &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6MWODwIhaEYqa994aF20My?si=aa71ae2270f946da&quot;&gt;(coffee’s for closers)&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;change will come / i will never believe in anything again&lt;/em&gt; certainly does. and yet i think the way i felt about these songs at sixteen is just as true and real as the way i feel about them now. it’s a little different, sure, but fall out boy’s music will always hook into something deep at the core of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was pete wentz who first taught me that it was okay to feel things deeply and to express them however you want to. it was pete and patrick’s creative relationship that taught me that someone else can catch the worst thoughts you’ve ever had, and hold them, and sing them out loud, and the world won’t fall down around you. seeing the whole of you, and staying anyway. it was fall out boy who taught me that nobody can read your mind, so you have to tell them how you feel. it was fall out boy who taught me that vulnerability is a brave, beautiful, bold thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and they’ve kept teaching me that. the concert wasn’t a nostalgia trip. fall out boy were my number 2 artist of 2023 and my top song was &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/2DIo5VoBB6X1GzgpGbmMIF?si=e4f110ffd4ee4cce&quot;&gt;heartbreak feels so good&lt;/a&gt; (yikes!) i will always turn to fall out boy when i need a particular kind of comfort. standing in that crowd reminded me that part of me was shaped by this band, and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen (film)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jeon jungkook (of BTS) sometimes makes short films known as ‘golden closet films (g.c.f.)’. he recently uploaded a new one, so i revisited my personal favourite, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgTwJQ2CUqI&quot;&gt;g.c.f. in helsinki&lt;/a&gt;. i’ve talked before about how i love being let in to the love between other people love each other. true, the sincerity of these displays can be a contentious issue when it comes to celebrities, particularly idols. how much of it is real? how much of it is done simply to satisfy fans? i have opinions on this (where’s that tweet that was like, &lt;em&gt;i don’t care if it’s fanservice as long as the fan they’re servicing is me&lt;/em&gt;). but i also think that nobody could possibly doubt the sincerity of jungkook’s love for the other members of BTS, and their love for him, after watching g.c.f. in helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i believe that paying attention and bearing witness are some of the purest forms of love, and so i’ve been interested lately in the extent to which the camera and photography can be a vehicle for expressions of loving someone. g.c.f. in helsinki captures this perfectly, in so many ways. the film feels almost insubstantial at times, like a lost dream slipping out of your reach; but the members bring it back with their aliveness and beauty. the colours shift from grey to warm as the camera lingers on namjoon. the bright leaves and the music swells into the shot of jimin. i said to zoë (while crying hard tears over it in the pub) that there’s a sadness to the video; a nostalgia, almost, for this moment in time where they are all together and young and untouchable. it’s suffused with the fragility of being around the people you love most in the world, who are part of your heart and soul, who have shaped you irrevocably—and knowing that nothing is guaranteed, and the future is coming for you all, and that you may never have this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why has it taken me so long to get on the tana french train? her &lt;em&gt;dublin murder squad&lt;/em&gt; books are about everything i love: how every story is told from a certain perspective, the overturning of the narrative you tell yourself, how relation absolutely fucks you all the way up, solving mysteries, buddy cops. they’re happy valley meets line of duty meets endeavour in literary form, and i couldn’t be more obsessed. here are some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;in the woods&lt;/em&gt;. the first instalment and probably my favourite. narrated by detective rob ryan, who survived the mysterious disappearance (and probable murder) of his two childhood best friends when he was 12 years old. another crime occurs in the very same woods, years later—and he’s now a murder squad detective, and sent to investigate. this obviously does severe damage to his psyche, which was already damaged enough to begin with. midway through reading this, i messaged arenike going, “is there going to be some fucked up twist where it turns out that rob did both crimes”, and she replied, “no, he just needs therapy &amp;lt;3”. never have truer words been spoken. rob has never come to terms with the loss of his friends, never even really spoken about them, and so he has no idea how deeply their disappearance has shaped him, nor how his survivor’s guilt has coloured just about every relationship he’s had since. including… you guessed it, the one with his murder squad partner, cassie. these two honestly had me shaking crying screaming throwing up. they have the perfect partnership and friendship, but rob’s inability to a) communicate b) make a lasting connection with someone c) get over himself or d) realise that he’s not the only one who might have hidden pain and trauma means that things implode spectacularly. the fallout is horrible, culminating in an incredibly tense interrogation between cassie and the perpetrator of the most recent murder, while rob listens from afar, unable to do anything. 10/10!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the likeness.&lt;/em&gt; now this one really fucked me up. cassie, fresh out of the aforementioned implosion of her partnership with rob, takes on an undercover mission in the house of four phd students. cassie’s desperation to belong is so palpable, and her grief over the loss of rob actually made me want to tear my hair out. every time she mentioned him it was like squeezing lemon juice into a cut. it’s a pain deeper and more profound than a broken heart: she’s lost the person she thought belonged to her irrevocably and the best partnership she’s ever had, and now things will always be different. there will always be moments when she needs rob, and remembers once again that he’s never coming back. some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I used to have a partner,” I said, “at work. We were like you guys: we matched. People talked about us the way you do about twins, like we were one person—‘That’s MaddoxandRyan’s case, get MaddoxandRyan to do it . . .’ If anyone had asked me, I’d have said this was it: the two of us, for the rest of our careers, we’d retire on the same day so neither of us would ever have to work with anyone else and the squad would give us one gold watch between us. I didn’t think about any of that at the time, mind. I just took it for granted. I couldn’t imagine anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was this night, during our last case. At three in the morning I got on my Vespa and went down to the crime scene to pick Rob up. On the way back the roads were all ours, that late, and I was going fast; Rob leaned into the turns with me and the bike barely seemed to feel the extra weight. Two high beams came at us around a bend, brilliant and growing till they filled the whole road: a lorry, half over the center line and coming straight for us, but the bike swayed out of the way light as a stalk of grass and the lorry was past in a great whack of wind and dazzle. Rob’s hands on my waist shook every now and then, a quick violent tremor, and I was thinking of home and warmth and whether I had anything in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of us knew it, but we were speeding through the last few hours we had. I leaned on that friendship loose and unthinking as if it were a wall six foot thick, but less than a day later it started to crumble and avalanche and there was nothing in “the world I could do to hold it together. In the nights afterwards I used to wake up with my mind full of those headlights, brighter and deeper than the sun. I saw them again behind my eyelids in that dark lane, and I understood then that I could have just kept driving. I could have been like Lexie. I could have hit full speed and taken us soaring up off the road, into the vast silence at the heart of those lights and out on the other side where nothing could touch us, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;me, personally? i am doing not so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;faithful place.&lt;/em&gt; this book suffers from being narrated by frank mackey, a man who sucks. rob, at the very least, had some semblance of self-awareness about his own issues, but frank has this self-righteousness that pervades everything he does and it is deeply aggravating. anyway: this book deals with him returning home to faithful place, where he grew up, after an absence of over twenty years. he’s always thought that he was dumped by his first love on the night they were supposed to elope to england, but when rosie’s suitcase turns up hidden in a chimney in an abandoned house on the street, it turns out that the truth might be slightly different. i loved this book for its incredible evocation of frank’s neighbourhood and the dynamics between the families who live there, the dialogue, the evocation of life in the 80s and how it’s changed now. the dynamic between frank and his siblings (two older, two younger) is perfectly done: the right amount of hate, love, resentment, fear, envy and long, long memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;broken harbor.&lt;/em&gt; the most harrowing of her books by far. scorcher kennedy learns the hard way that the world is not black and white; that bootstrap theory is a myth, that sometimes people go insane for no reason and sometimes people go insane because capitalism is a life-destroying system that chews people up and spits them out when they’re no longer of use. something that i had on my mind while reading this is how clear scorcher’s fallibilities are and how they blind him to what was going on in the home of the spain family, whose brutal murders he is investigating. he’s so convinced of his own reality and way of perceiving the world and he simply can’t conceive of a different perspective. that conviction has its roots in his teenage years and the death of his mother, and a heartbreaking scene at the end of the book reveals exactly why he keeps such a tight control on his own reality—to let go would be absolutely devastating to his psyche. but let go he must, after being put through tana’s blender and forced to open his eyes. woof. this was unputdownable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the secret place.&lt;/em&gt; probably my least favourite of the collection? i love our man stephen, who narrates the novel, but he’s not quite interesting enough to get me really engaged. fresh out of cold cases with a piece of interesting evidence on a murdered schoolboy, he’s partnered up with antoinette conway (more on her later), who couldn’t solve the original case. i really enjoyed the way the past and present narratives wove together in this one, and how deftly tana evokes how obsessive and all-consuming teenage friendship can be. also loved the multiple sequential interrogation scenes, with stephen adopting a new character each time to get the girls to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the trespasser.&lt;/em&gt; a close second favourite novel. stephen is now on the murder squad and partnered with conway, who is our narrator and takes absolutely no shit, is tough as nails and would rather die than let the collection of murder squad bullies (all minus stephen who remains a sweetheart) drive her out of her job. this one has the best murder mystery plot of all the novels!! the themes of adopted narratives, perspective, spinning stories to ourselves and others, belief in each other and where it can get you—all present in tana’s other books but here they’re knotted together in such a delicious and tight way. conway’s the perfect person to be in charge of these themes, and i loved her developing partnership with stephen and how finally having someone on her side helps her to unravel those knots and get to the heart of the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free palestine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a couple of articles that i’ve found illuminating and clarifying on palestinian resistance and october 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stevesalaita.com/a-practical-appraisal-of-palestinian-violence/&quot;&gt;a practical appraisal of palestinian violence&lt;/a&gt; by steve salaita&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of temptation to wag fingers in the aftermath of the operation, but surely that task is not the domain of academics and activists in the metropole.  Nor should it be the priority of diaspora Palestinians (among whom I include myself).  In our environs, filled with their own kind of hostility, the priority should be to defend Palestinians against the torment to which they have been subjected by the entire industrialized world.  Among politicians, artists, celebrities, and intellectuals, Palestinians have no shortage of critics happy to cosign Zionist genocide.  Those critics don’t need or desire our validation, anyway.  Abandoning our brethren in order to appease the Zionist establishment will deliver no accolades.  In the end, the aspirant to respectability is left only with the shame of conciliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palestinians are perfectly capable of formulating strategy and thinking through complex problems without the guidance of outsiders; they certainly don’t need half-baked moralism from dorks and social climbers in the West.  The Palestinian story isn’t esoteric or inaccessible.  In fact, one can discover the rationale for Palestinian violence anywhere in the great mass of revolutionary writing from Amilcar Cabral to Bassel al-Araj.  That intellectuals who have made lucrative careers with tough-sounding buzzwords were so eager to condemn an actual instance of Indigenous resistance is a damning (and in my mind permanent) indictment of Western academe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ebb-magazine.com/essays/an-unyielding-will-to-continue&quot;&gt;an unyielding will to continue&lt;/a&gt;: abdaljawad omar interviewed by louis allday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many think that solidarity with Palestine is a unidirectional action meant to provide Palestinians with support, a sense of psychological relief that our struggle does not meet deaf ears. I am more interested in the other side of the equation, on what the Palestinian struggle uncovers about the institutional, economic, and structural realities for those in the global north, the Arab world, and global south. To me the Palestinian struggle exposes truths, reveals fascisms, and emboldens trajectories of change, radical political, and economic change in these societies – or at least it should do so. Palestine is not a nationalist, nor a religious, nor a feel-good cause. It is not simply a ceasefire movement. Our gift to the world [was] given through our blood, especially for those interested in a more just, more economically equal, decolonial, deracialized world. The struggle we lead reveals hidden discourses of imperialisms and forces centres of power to reveal their schizophrenic stances and hypocritical posturing. This is why Palestine is a universal struggle, a place for the condensation of truth in a post-truth historical conjecture. It is also a place from which the imperial metropole, and those within it suffering from racialized inequalities, can see in Palestine and its struggle a natural and political affinity. Historically the Palestinian struggle galvanised the left, and helped construct new modes of political engagements. This is precisely the reason why pro-Israel networks are attempting to shut down the discussion through fear and intimidation tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The October 7 operation has perhaps overcome the central role of the Israeli state in accumulation on a world scale: ingraining a state of defeat amongst the Arab working classes, as part-and-parcel of the post-Soviet ideological defeat imposed by capital upon labor globally. Deterrence is the form that defeat takes when pushed to the military plane, and Israel openly admits that its deterrence has been shattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen from this perspective, the risks run by the western capitalist states – their imposition of fascist regulation against freedoms of speech and assembly, their backing for genocide, their desperation to see the Palestinian armed militia wiped from the face of the Earth – is logical, reasonable, and rational in its sociopathy. It is the logic of monopoly attempting to defend itself and the consciousness which bodyguards it with fire from the sky. It is a logic which fills graveyards, and a logic which makes orphans, and it is a logic which might yet meet its end in that crossroads of continents – that salient, and city and their camps and their people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello! it’s october again, which means i’m about to get even more reflective, deranged and earnest than usual as we head deeper into autumn and winter. sorry. it’s truly out of my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[cn for suicide mention]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in lucy dacus’ song &lt;em&gt;please stay&lt;/em&gt;, widely believed to be about julien baker, she sings: “i believe you mean what you say, when you say you want to die / i believe you mean what you say, when you say you want to stay alive”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve been trying to write this essay on julien baker and her third album, &lt;em&gt;little oblivions,&lt;/em&gt; for a while. i think those lyrics go to the heart of what i want to say. listening to julien baker convinces you of two things: one, that life contains a lot of suffering, perhaps too much for one person to bear; and two, that death is not the only way to liberate yourself from that. that an honest reflection on the pain you have been through and caused can open up a path to a different sort of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i discovered julien baker through listening to boygenius, and then by reading an excerpt from hanif abdurraqib’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stereogum.com/2102881/julien-baker-little-oblivions-faith-healer/music/&quot;&gt;album notes&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;little oblivions,&lt;/em&gt; where he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grand project of Julien Baker, as I have always projected it onto myself, is the central question of what someone does with the many calamities of a life they didn’t ask for, but want to make the most out of. I have long been done with the idea of hope in such a brutal and unforgiving world, but I’d like to think that this music drags me closer to the old idea I once clung to. But these are songs of survival, and songs of reimagining a better self, and what is that if not hope? Hope that on the other side of our wreckage — self-fashioned or otherwise — there might be a door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i truly cannot imagine a higher endorsement of someone’s art than the above paragraph. so i listened to &lt;em&gt;little oblivions&lt;/em&gt; and felt like i was being stripped down to my bones. i have listened to a lot of confessional music in my time, but i have never listened to songs like these before. ones that confront someone’s self-destruction in such a relational way. that are deeply aware of what the harm you wish upon yourself does to others. a few newsletters ago, i wrote that i love music that “reaches into the gaping maw at the heart of you, pulls out everything you think is wrong about yourself, and sets it loose”. this album, julien baker’s music, does that. but it also holds you to account. it says, no matter how dark things get, there is always someone in the world out there who loves you. even if you are hurting so badly you can’t quite believe it, there is a small part of you that will always know this to be true. and, on the other side of the coin, there are people that you love. and you are letting them down. you are using up your second chances, and your third chances, and your fourth chances. and what do you do about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes, that question makes me want to run for the hills; cut myself out of every web of relation i’m part of and vanish entirely. it is a difficult thing to confront. but through listening to these songs, relentless in their commitment to self-excavation, i see a better and more honest way forward than disappearance. this album shows how opening yourself up to rigorous scrutiny can be a map towards understanding, towards redemption. not as something bestowed by an external force, but within yourself. that’s a kind of liberation, i think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these songs are gutting, they are painful, they are raw. you could be forgiven for listening to little oblivions and finding it bleak. but i agree with hanif’s assessment that these songs contain so much hope in them. i have thought a lot about vulnerability over the last year or so. to me, allowing the worst thoughts you’ve ever had or the worst things you’ve ever done to be heard by other people is an act both of hope and of freedom. freedom from shame and humiliation, from easy resolution. freedom from the idea that we are always progressing towards something better. sometimes we’re &lt;em&gt;on a long spiral down&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes we’re &lt;em&gt;stuck inside a vision that repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats.&lt;/em&gt; but as long as we can find the words to express ourselves, as long as we have the desire to reach for redemption for ourselves—hope is not lost. there might be a door—and one day, you might be able to step through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i reread &lt;em&gt;piranesi&lt;/em&gt; on the plane—like the first time i read it, in one big gulp. there’s something so magnetic about the story, how it sets up the mystery of piranesi’s House and perceptions and then slowly overturns them. i don’t know how to articulate this exactly, but it’s such a pure story. the tenderness and goodness that suffuses piranesi’s perspective; his optimism and wonder. something i really noticed on this reread was that when he realises what has happened to matthew rose sorensen, when he realises how he has been tricked, he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; get angry. he plots revenge. he doesn’t just accept it. that feels hugely important to me. the anger courses through him and he explores every corner of the feelings of rage and vengeance—and then he lets it pass through him. he moves to a place of peace. and, of course, the generous, gentle ending will always move me deeply. the person who is not piranesi and not matthew rose sorensen looking out at the world, our world, and viewing it with such tenderness and respect. i’ve been listening to young lagoon’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/3bXZ7OC22m5hqYNv6gR8cd?si=fe29e649d4294148&quot;&gt;prizefighter&lt;/a&gt; a lot recently on zoë’s recommendation, and these lines will always be associated with piranesi now: &lt;em&gt;i got the world so i’ll be fine / i got the sunshine to figure me out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a new book that blew me away was ann patchett’s &lt;em&gt;tom lake&lt;/em&gt;. i reviewed it fully &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CxqkOVDrLPl/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; so i won’t repeat myself. but i did want to talk about how i’ve read several of ann patchett’s novels previously and none of them have had a particularly deep effect on me. i always like her character work and i think she has a gift for observing people’s inner lives. her writing is good, a safe bet in a charity shop or a library where you want a novel that you’ll read to the end and enjoy. but what bothered me about all the other books i’ve read was that for all her deft observation, she often chose to write about settings and scenarios which she has no familiarity with. i’m not saying that authors can’t do this and do it well. but i think that’s what always tripped me up about her novels. there was a ring of inauthenticity to them, or plain cultural insensitivity (such as state of wonder). anyway, like i said she’s usually a safe bet for a solid middle-of-the-road read, so when i saw &lt;em&gt;tom lake&lt;/em&gt; was out, that’s what i was expecting. i was not expecting to be so affected by this book i would put it down and stare into space for a few seconds at the crucial moments; nor that it would make me cry. finally, she’s is writing about an experience (and the type of people) she knows intimately well and my god, it paid off. when i turned to the end and found out that &lt;em&gt;our town,&lt;/em&gt; the play that is central to the happenings of the novel, is one of patchett’s favourite works of literature, it wasn’t surprising to me at all. it’s a deeply moving and poignant novel, about growing up and growing old, about second chances, about moving on, about first love, about the gulf between what you thought you when you were young and what you got in the end, and about how what you got is actually what you did want all along. it is so deftly plotted; all the details slot into place perfectly. the only small criticism i have is that the ending does trail off. it felt like she used up all her chest-punching energy during the middle parts of the novel, and then the last pages are quiet, dying away. i think it could have been more powerful. but overall, a spectacular novel and one that i’m sure i will revisit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some thoughts from touring the roman ruins of anatolia. the first city we went to was ephesus, which was magnificent. i have never walked through an ancient city before, and it really affected me. to be physically in the space where two thousand years ago people were living, working, dreaming; to walk the marble streets where they would have walked, to wander through their homes, see where they would have cooked and bathed. there’s something connective about it, for sure, particularly seeing things like graffiti or clay pipes or central heating or latrines. there’s a line between us and them. but what struck me most of all was the gulf that exists between me and the people and the world i know, and the people who lived then and the world they knew. some things do feel the same but how can i claim that our perceptions of it would be similar, when the society and politics and religion and economics these people lived under were all so different to what they are now? so much of their perceptions and understanding has been lost. it made me think: what will be left of us, when we are gone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the second city was aphrodisias, which was our favourite, mainly because there were hardly any people there except for us. we were totally alone in the remains of the amphitheatre. the acoustics in there were insane! asa stood on the stage and whispered and we could hear him from the back. he recited jabberwocky and it made me feel so emotional. people stood right there two thousand years ago and spoke! and now here my little brother is! there was also a stadium, where sports/chariot races took place. it had a capacity of 30,000! to stand in the centre of that was insane. i thought about how we have stadiums and theatres and concert halls now, how we still have the desire to cram ourselves into seats next to strangers and be united in our love of sports or plays. to be entertained as a crowd, a collective. to be unified by that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank god abeera is committed to watching the sopranos with me, because if not for her i think i might have given up by now. i need another person with me to turn to in shock as the show takes an increasingly bleak and violent turn. the episode where tony keeps questioning people, AM I A TOXIC PERSON?? whew. okay. we’re far from the hee hee ha ha days of season one where it was funny to witness his inability to handle his emotions in a reasonable way; or to be honest in therapy. his volatile personality IS toxic actually! he’s incapable of meaningfully connecting with anyone. it’s no wonder carmela’s eye is wandering, it’s no wonder christopher is slipping further and further into addiction (this is extremely painful to watch!!), it’s no wonder he’s constantly attracted to unstable, temperamental women because it’s a way for him to exercise control, it’s no wonder he can only show empathy for animals. god, the scene where he beats ralph to death and then calls christopher over to chop him up in the bath? borderline unwatchable. it is a testament to the show’s writing and plotting that i actually felt sympathy for ralph, after two seasons of saying, “god i can’t wait for ralph to die”. the show was like: oh really? see how you like THIS!! and i didn’t like it. i did not like it at all. after every episode i feel like i need to lie down with a cold cloth over my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello! it’s been over a year since i started this substack, which feels absolutely wild. thanks for sticking around all this time. here’s what i’ve been thinking about so far in september—a month that always feels new to me, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a few weeks ago hayley messaged me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/heathensquirrel/status/1693203564703653956&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;, a challenge i took to with enthusiasm and much stress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://changethepear.com/images/17_a.webp&quot; alt=&quot;texts w hay about 20 song challenge&quot; width=&quot;600&quot;&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;obviously i ended up with two versions: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1nwzAOmeinyWw0HAyz1n3l?si=88beda55d1ff4904&quot;&gt;20(ish) long one&lt;/a&gt; and a 50 song &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1S40RYAdhPFPd49wFU3V3E?si=6bf9470c2f8d4978&quot;&gt;extended edition&lt;/a&gt;. sorry but i am a girl of chaotic taste and an expansive heart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you haven’t done this yet, please do and send it to me. that’s a serious request! as fun as it was to build my own playlists, listening to other people’s versions of this playlist has been my favourite part of this exercise. they are all so different! sometimes i share artists with people, or even specific songs; other times our playlists are more like siblings or cousins (as kallie said, &lt;em&gt;it’s the tumblr&lt;/em&gt;). i’ll click on a playlist and think &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; seeing a particular track someone’s picked (kallie choosing casanova baby, hayley choosing dis-ease, siyang choosing up the wolves, alfie choosing eight, em choosing criminal). but i love being surprised by people’s choices too! as i type this, i’m listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/77xA8SWMHXiejvM7rbfZQQ?si=0f63a9fb1dbc4489&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt;, which i found by listening to zoë’s 20 songs and fixating on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;music always gives a profound insight into our psyches, but i love this particular challenge for how it asks people to consider what songs give them the most feeling. it’s not the music that you think is cool or technically “the best”. it’s teenage dream (glee cast version). it’s the ketchup song by las ketchup. it’s woof woof by shinee. it’s nine inch nails by closer. it’s feel by robbie williams. it’s shine by hilary duff. it’s bet on it from high school musical 2. it’s weightless by all time low. (not all of these are my choices, fyi!!!) it’s the songs that make you say, &lt;em&gt;god, turn that up,&lt;/em&gt; that spark something deep in you, that you would know any time, anywhere. and what a joy it is to learn what those songs are for other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;only friends is currently rotating around and around inside my brain like a pig on a spit. excuse the visceral simile but i don’t know how else to emphasise how i’m feeling right now!!! i think i last wrote this newsletter when i’d only seen episode one; there have now been five episodes, each more insane and messy than the last. of our six main characters/pairings (boston-nick, top-mew, sand-ray) it’s ray and sand that are driving me to distraction in particular. &lt;a href=&quot;https://sollucets.tumblr.com/post/728252118250799104/episode-five-raysand-indecent-eye-contact&quot;&gt;their chemistry alone&lt;/a&gt; would be enough to have me obsessed, but the details of their dynamic are what is truly making me want to chew glass. briefly: we have ray, a fucked up rich boy who has been in unrequited love with his best friend mew for years and has developed several unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with years of his friends and family making him believe that he is a burden on them. feeling adrift from the group, particularly when mew gets a new boyfriend, he becomes fascinated by sand, a spiky, moody bar singer who dreams of being a rock star and who finds himself drawn to ray’s charms even as he’s desperately trying not to be. in the last episode, they have a 24 hour long date—ray goes home with sand the night before, sand cooks him breakfast, and ray proposes going along with sand for his whole day, “to get to know him better” (devastatingly romantic. in MY opinion). anyway, everything is going great: they go shopping, they go to a concert, ray does karaoke at sand’s mother’s bar (cue sand’s mom leaning over to him to go, “i don’t think he’s just a friend….”), they end up back at sand’s again, ray tells sand about his trauma, they start hooking up. and THEN sand’s roommate nick brings home ray’s friend boston, who, in a truly asshole move, starts taunting sand that he’s always going to be second best, because “ray’s entire ass is owned by mew”, and everything blows up spectacularly. woof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s so painful to watch ray in these scenes. how he can’t see how much sand does like him because he’s blunted his ability to discern when people think he’s special, having spent so much time believing he was special to mew and being proven wrong. opening yourself up to something new after an experience like that is tough! it’s not easy to risk the heart! and ray is trying, in his way. he feels this irresistible attraction to sand, and he wants to understand him; he wants to be a part of sand’s life. i believe the heart is a capacious thing and there can be room for both an old love of a best friend (dwindling, but still there) and a new love arriving on the horizon. but ray’s problem is that he’s too mired in his own self-loathing to recognise that arrival or believe that it’s something he can have. sand doesn’t exactly help, with his i’m-better-off-alone self-protective armour making him say stuff like, “i’ll never take someone like you as my boyfriend”; “i wouldn’t trust you with my life”, even as his expressions and general body language are expressing the exact opposite. but the worst part is that if not for boston’s interference, they might have been able to escape the boundaries they’ve set on themselves as they spend more time together. instead, ray’s drawn back into his old belief that he’s so fucked up that the person he loves most will never love him back and sand is made to feel like he’s not special to ray and never will be. and then, lying in the dark afterwards, ray’s too scared to openly talk about his feelings for mew and sand’s too scared to ask. so they don’t talk about it. oh, and it’s sand’s birthday, which they’re both aware of. by the way! just another twist of the knife for them. ugh! pain! agony! i’ve rewatched all of their scenes at least three times this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alfie and i saw boygenius twice in the last week of august—once in halifax and once in kingston at a small acoustic set. i’m glad i went to both, because they were such different atmospheres. loved the festival, open-air energy of the halifax show, the big stage and the guitars and the rocking out. but the acoustic set was much calmer, and it really let the quieter songs breathe. i particularly loved ‘we’re in love’—i couldn’t see lucy as she was singing but i could see phoebe and julien, and it was clear how much the song meant to them. when they came in on the line, &lt;em&gt;the hummingbirds, you know the ones (i know the ones),&lt;/em&gt; i started crying_._ i’ve been thinking a lot about the vulnerability inherent in the boygenius project—what it takes to collaborate with your best friends, to share the process of creation with people you love so deeply. but not only that—to also explicitly write about the feelings you have for one another, and allow that to be seen by an audience. as a big fan of public declarations of affection, i always love seeing the way people love one another writ large. but what i admire so much about boygenius is that their songs aren’t just about the beautiful, tender moments. they acknowledge that there’s pain in loving people, too. there’s hurt (unintentional and intentional) we can do to one another when we’re so deeply intertwined. and they’re open about that! what an incredible thing, to be trusted with all the facets of such a deep relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just finished reading &lt;em&gt;ancillary justice&lt;/em&gt; by ann leckie. i tend to prefer sci-fi that’s character-motivated and driven rather than stories that focus on intricate worldbuilding, which is why it’s taken me so long to read, despite it being a classic. the worldbuilding &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; incredibly detailed and involved but i was pleasantly surprised by how much i liked the characters here, especially the relationships breq/one esk forms with lieutenant awn and seivarden. really enjoyed the way the backstory is revealed in tandem with the main plot. also thought breq’s narrative voice was very well written and delicately done—just the right level of detachment and impartiality, with the reader being allowed to draw their own conclusions as to her emotional state and motivations at moments where she can’t/doesn’t reveal them to us. particularly liked how it’s slowly revealed that one esk sings &lt;em&gt;all the time,&lt;/em&gt; something that sets her apart from other parts of herself, and from other ships and AIs_._ anyway i was impressed with how it’s wholly believable that she’s an AI severed away from the multiple parts of herself. i think seivarden could have done with a little more focus and development, tbh, but i’m hoping that might happen in the second/third instalments of the trilogy. one thing i appreciated a lot about leckie’s writing is how well she understands that the socio-cultural environment someone is raised in will shape their actions and beliefs really deeply. her characters aren’t humans who have been transported into a new setting in space. they are radchaai, they are AIs, they are non-radchaai conquered by an empire that wishes to subdue and civilise them. it’s an impressive, confident and assured work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also reread &lt;em&gt;confabulations&lt;/em&gt; by john berger this week, and have been struck anew by how good it is, how intelligent and observant he is. he touches on lifelong friendship, on the making of art, of witnessing, of the power of songs and music to move us. reading it, i feel the intentionality of his language, how each word is exactly the right one. i feel the fullness of life, and all that it holds and can offer us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally cooking mushrooms for elete. the bountiful produce in my parents’ garden. the catharsis of, once again, crying in arenike and lee’s kitchen. making claire a pasta sauce with the sweetest, ripest orange cherry tomatoes. drinking an indulgent amount of wine. wandering the henry moore sculpture gallery with alfie. the absolute joy and excitement of writing collaboratively with zoë. finding pleasure in telling a story again! rereading good omens. hiking with jocelyne. seeing mont blanc from all angles. breathing in huge lungfuls of the crisp clear air of the alps. how cold the lakes were and how good it felt to jump in them. fresh bread and frozen margaritas and good wine and delicious charcuterie. akua bringing her ateez dvd to the park on a swelteringly hot day. poetry reading with agnes on the theme of “things from the room in the back”. tins with claire on a warm evening. abeera teaching me how to cook lamb mince and spiced cauliflower. watching the paradigm music video with zoë. plotting out [redacted] with alfie. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/elisabeth-reidy/180554414502/an-honourable-human-relationship-that-is-one-in&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; adrienne rich quote. &lt;a href=&quot;https://firstfullmoon.tumblr.com/post/726966090966663168/diane-seuss-where-is-the-drug-to-drug-this&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; dianne seuss poem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://papenathys.tumblr.com/post/726543386767769600/absolutely-insane-lines-to-just-drop-in-the-middle&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; extract on hamlet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://lunchboxpoems.tumblr.com/post/697406250533666817/your-damage&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; mary biddinger poem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/peelingmandarins/715182449696636928/a-child-free-from-the-guilt-of-ownership-and-the&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; ursula le guin quote. reading marisa’s brilliant, insightful dissertation on fanfiction. bouldering in the peak district. burgers and grilled vegetables on an open fire. a gorgeous sunrise after a night of rain. a long conversation with laura on the way home about vulnerability and honesty and trusting people to hold the worst parts of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a whole year of these! thank you for reading, as always. see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! can you believe august is almost over? i once saw someone describe august as “the sunday of months” and that’s how i’ve felt these past weeks. somewhat adrift, a slight sense of dread at what’s on the horizon, panic that i’m not making the most of the light warm days. the reminder that everything is temporary, and the seasons always change. sometimes that’s comforting, sometimes it’s not. but it happens all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;listening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: siyang can you make me a carly rae jepsen playlist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIYANG: sure, let me know what your favourite songs are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6cDPJqKw8PUBw5SigKszrL?si=5fa8489780e544eb&quot;&gt;want you in my room&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6c6vULMrRuN4NECs2iB1xe?si=0d964697244646cf&quot;&gt;the loneliest time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/7I7Dk8FOkZqhqZp9N2RKiP?si=f70842322f874418&quot;&gt;talking to yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIYANG: desperation we love to hear it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scalped, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;currently watching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;new thai BL alert! i started watching &lt;em&gt;only friends,&lt;/em&gt; a show which has been driving the girls crazy literally since it was announced, because it’s got a cast of seasoned BL actors and the plot is, as far as i can tell, about being gay and messy as fuck. all the characters exist somewhere on the venn diagram of slut-princess-loser, one of them is literally called ‘top’, and i’m having a fantastic time. when ray (who is currently lying bang in the middle of the aforementioned diagram) gets sand (princess-slut) to light his cigarette…spiral-eyes emoji. honestly, though, these actors GET it. the chemistry is off the charts; boston (slut-loser) and nick (loser) especially had me screaming. that scene in the phone shop, whew! and the expressiveness of the acting is just so good. masterclasses in dropping subtle hints that are immediately recognisable when you are familiar with the general behaviours that go on in a messy friend group: ray’s painfully obvious crush on mew, boston clearly having slept with top already, etc. so excited to see where this one goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;last seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;god. i guess it’s time to talk about good omens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve been sat here for five minutes trying to think of how to explain what is going on inside of my brain right now. did i have a good time watching the show? yes. was it a bad show with a plot that made little to no sense? also yes. is it on constant rotation in my mind since i watched the final episode of season 2? you guessed it: yes. in many ways i’m at a point in my life where i am regressing in order to cope, so watching the entirety of an otherwise terrible tv show because i am deeply compelled by the interactions of two old men makes a lot of sense for my character arc right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. david tennant is utterly mesmerising and somehow also deeply attractive as crowley. listen i don’t like it any more than you do but i have to speak my truth. and michael sheen as aziraphale is delivering the acting performance of the YEAR with his every gesture and look absolutely loaded with feeling, nuance and homosexual implications. the dialogue is straight out of every homoerotically-charged queerbaited television show from the 2010s but bass boosted. (CROWLEY: when gabriel smites you you’ve been smited? smut? smote? AZIRAPHALE: smitten, i believe.) and the dynamic is totally nuts. it’s “we might be on opposite sides but you’ve been my most consistent companion for the last 6000 years and over that time we’ve come to understand each other deeply and, more than that, &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; for one another. become a little bit nicer and a little bit more of a bastard for each other—become more human. we’ve learned to love the world and the people in it wholly and fully, together”. i mean, jesus christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then, after all that, suddenly it’s real? there’s a tragic gay love confession and half-unrequited kiss that ends in heartbreak? are you fucking kidding me right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if it was just the show, i think i’d still be insane, but good omens has always meant so much more to me than the adaptation. which is why this entire thing is a particularly insane journey to be on right now. i don’t know how to explain it other than this summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you don’t get it you simply don’t get it. i don’t know what else to say. aziraphale/crowley forever! thanks! bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##&lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes you just need to sit down and reread your favourite books for the fifth time. the thing about the locked tomb series by tamsyn muir is that no matter how many times i read each one, there are always new pieces of information to pick up on, word choices to pay attention to, lines of dialogue that take on entirely different dimensions when you look at them with fresh eyes. the plots are so intricate, the prose is so deliberate, that you can always find something new to pick apart or theorise about. on this reread alone i’ve made a list of about fifteen questions i have on various details and plot points. and i know that somewhere tamsyn has the answers! that’s the most satisfying part! every bit of these books has been thought through entirely and i can’t wait to see how it all links together in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the whole i’m a person who is given to hyperbole, as i’m sure you all know by now. but you have to trust me when i say that &lt;em&gt;harrow the ninth&lt;/em&gt; is a work of genius. even when i know what’s coming, the adrenaline rush this book gives me is absolutely unparalleled. although i do believe it has to be read in conjunction with &lt;em&gt;gideon the ninth&lt;/em&gt; in order to truly comprehend how brilliant it is. in fact, i don’t think i’ll ever come across a better book-sequel pairing than gideon the ninth and harrow the ninth. a masterclass in how to write a complementary and yet also entirely different follow-up to a novel. reading harrow enables you to fully understand the events of gideon, both by giving you new information and, at the same time, by turning old information on its head by literally recontextualising the entire universe and your assumptions about it. it answers your questions but then says, &lt;em&gt;hey, consider this: were those the right questions to be asking in the first place??&lt;/em&gt; don’t even get me started on the canaan house sections—retelling the original story of gideon the ninth but with a cast of characters who were sidelined in the first book, whom you might not have paid attention to or who died before they could make much of an impact on the story. i couldn’t care less about ortus when i first read gideon the ninth and now i want to cry every time i think about him. everybody is given the chance to shape the narrative; nobody is left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there’s a lot to admire in this novel, the way it writes about grief and delusion and desire; about lies and forgiveness; about loving someone so much and still misunderstanding them completely. the sections from gideon’s point of view will never fail to undo me (“Harrowhark, I gave you my whole life and you didn’t even want it.” OKAY!!! GOD!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but i think my favourite part is how the book plays with form and structure to address one of its key themes: storytelling. a shift in perspective gives you access to a completely different understanding of events. showing that who is in control shapes the stories we tell and are told, and therefore also changes our understanding of the world and our place in it in a very real sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the final fight scenes between the sleeper and the ghosts in canaan house and harrowhark are such a good example of this. initially we’re in harrow’s story: the necromancers use their powers to try and exorcise the sleeper; but as the sleeper exercises her willpower to take control of the narrative, her hatred of necromancy means she can fight anything the necromancers do with ease. then, when ortus calls the ghost of matthias nonius, suddenly we step into an entirely different story, an epic ancient poem where the sleeper’s guns no longer work. it’s so smart and so satisfying when you look at the book as a whole and realise: that’s the whole point. it’s a novel entirely about the difference between the narratives we construct and those that are constructed for us. about the multi-faceted reality we all inhabit; and how our perception of it can materially affect our actions and choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! i’ve given up any semblance of a regular schedule for this newsletter. clearly i have very little control over when i have thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on repeat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##&lt;strong&gt;last seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;field notes from the prado museum in madrid. i wrote these while i wandered around, intending to edit them later, but i actually think they’re better left as they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;el greco&lt;/strong&gt;: sinuous, surprisingly modern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;caravaggio&lt;/strong&gt;: muscles! chiaroscuro! humanity! beauty in ugliness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reubens&lt;/strong&gt;’ apostles: so much character. st thomas is just like me for real&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;titian&lt;/strong&gt;’s virgin dolorosas and simon helping jesus with the cross. emphasis on the felt weight of someone taking on your burden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goya&lt;/strong&gt;: royal portraits bad boo hiss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3rd of may&lt;/em&gt; very moving, visceral in bloody bodies on floor, frozen moment in time, shock and confusion and fear on man’s face as he raises his hands, white of his shirt, spotlit almost. anonymity of his executioners. innocence. wide-eyed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the black paintings&lt;/em&gt;, named bc of colour palette and subject matter, most of which is debated in meaning by art historians / psychologists. psychologists you ask? well yes these paintings are very creepy, disquieting. devil he-goat. saturn devouring his children. grotesque faces of pilgrims/witches. masses of people crowded together. ugly, disfigured. the fates—controlling, menacing. these were all in goya’s house btw. spooky. imagine walking into someone’s living room and there’s a huge mural of a giant devil goat and a mass of clamouring witches worshipping it. drowning dog what the fuck is going on there it’s just a dog’s head in an expanse of brown canvas, not a comforting image at all. stirred up so much feeling in me!!! did not want a postcard of that one. even the simple reading / laughing paintings have a sinister energy to them when placed alongside all these others. tbh i kind of get it i’d probably have some dark images i’d need to get out after spending a lifetime painting the royal family but man. these are very unsettling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hieronomous bosch&lt;/strong&gt;: weird. deeply weird. enjoyably so! this guy was painting whatever the fuck he wanted. fish with legs, a giant rat with wings herding people to hell, a house with the head of a woman, people doing god knows what inside an oyster shell, a pig in a wimple, two ears with a knife emerging from them, strange beasts devouring people. although the subject matter is bizarre and disturbing, these aren’t dark in the way goya’s paintings are, probably because of the colour palette being so bright and everything being so dynamic. it’s, dare i say, quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sánchez perrier&lt;/strong&gt;: beautiful drawings and ink wash paintings from his travels! i’m a sucker for this kind of art: canals and boats of venice, medinas of morocco, monasteries and bell towers in zaragoza, shepherds in seville. very lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;currently watching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;abeera and i are back on our bullshit (watching the sopranos). i know you’ve missed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because of the darker turn season 3 was taking, i was nervous about resuming our watch, but the episode we started with was the christmas episode, which honestly reminded me of all the things i love most about the show: fantastic character work, family dynamics, slick dialogue, humour, psychological complexity. jackie’s untimely end was horrific, but honestly felt inevitable after the entire season. ralph cifaretto, god will deal with you!!! i found the funeral/wake scenes again very psychologically interesting, in the ways everyone knows what has actually happened but has their own way of repressing it/coming to terms with it. meadow’s defense of her father to jackie’s cousin followed by her running out of the restaurant… hmmm. interested to see what happens with her in the subsequent seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first epsiode of season 4 made me laugh harder than i’ve ever laughed at the sopranos. after christopher is depicted in the pits of despair over his relationship with tony (side-note: feeling Very Bad about his increasing drug use…) and how he doesn’t feel like tony respects him or likes him anymore, tony tells dr melfi he’s currently in the process of permanently bonding christopher to him. sir you are so fucked up!!! other than that we’re setting up the problems for the new season: namely money problems, and uncle junior’s upcoming trial. also paulie somehow being in jail?! #FreeHim&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i am also watching the good omens tv adaptation, which i have avoided up until now. let me explain: as a teenager, good omens was EVERYTHING to me. i loved that book. i read it countless times. i know parts of it off by heart. my first tumblr url was a quote from it (if you know you know). so when the adaptation was announced, my first feeling was &lt;em&gt;i can never watch this, because what if i hate it?&lt;/em&gt; i can’t hate good omens. it would unravel a core part of my personal history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what changed is that mara said this about the end of season 2: “now the entire plot is going to hinge on a tragic and dramatic semi-aborted gay love confession and half-unrequited kiss that constitutes a SEASON CLIFFHANGER FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW” and i immediately messaged her like, what the fuck, and discovered that she a) has the same feeling about good omens as i do and b) loved the show. so i sat myself down and watched the first episode and i had so much fun. is it good? who cares. must a tv show be good? is it not enough to watch david tennant and michael sheen having the time of their lives in an adaptation of a deeply silly, much beloved book? well, it’s enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just finished &lt;em&gt;penance&lt;/em&gt; by eliza clark and i have a lot of thoughts! the novel is told in the form of a true crime investigation into the murder of 16-year-old joan wilson by her three schoolmates, written by a journalist, alec carelli. from the blurb and on the first page, we’re told that carelli’s book was refuted by his interviewees, which calls the reliability of his account into question. cool, unreliable narrator, i’m on board. but by the ending i was kind of like….okay what was the point of that conceit? the format of the novel is sections narrated by carelli in first person, where he interviews people connected with joan wilson and her murderers, and narrativised sections from the third-person perspective of each of the murderers. so within this, there is absolutely no way for the reader to tell whether the story or interviews are accurate or not. the happenings of the narrativised sections do not contradict each other nor do they contradict the content of the interviews, apart from showing different perspectives on certain actions. that unreliability is an inherent part of any story with multiple points of view imo! so why did we have to make this whole song and dance about “how much of the account is true”. idk, it just felt like a way of making the book feel more exciting and dramatic, but when it’s revealed in the final pages that certain details from one of the interviews were made up, i was like… whatever? sorry but i can’t be bothered to question everything i’m reading, when there are no alternative ways of interpretation offered. i hope this makes sense. it’s like reading a murder mystery and you fall for a red herring only to have information revealed right at the end that proves the murderer was someone else. i had no opportunity to know that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the obvious riposte to my argument is that eliza clark is making a point about the predatory and sensationalist nature of the true crime genre by having her journalist author follow exactly the path of the podcasters and internet commentators that he claims to hate: removing agency from those involved, turning horrific events into “content” to be distributed for fun and entertainment. but i think the book would do that anyway, without needing to heavily emphasise that carelli lied about certain details!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now for the actual content of the book. i read in many reviews that this book would scalp anyone who was on tumblr in 2014, so i was looking forward to an accurate representation of internet culture. and, don’t get me wrong, the details &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; accurate. it’s obviously written by someone with an intimate knowledge of tumblr and its users and the way people post/comment/argue on there. however, i found myself increasingly depressed over the way the book portrays the effect of the internet on lonely teens. as i mentioned, the central crime is the murder of joan wilson by three other teenage girls, all of whom use tumblr, albeit for different purposes. angelica loves musicals and glee; violet is interested in creepypastas and horror and anime; dolly is into serial killers, particularly those responsible for the (made-up) cherry creek massacre. what they all share is a crippling loneliness and pain from being outcast from social circles for various reasons, and finding solace in internet communities. what i found disturbing was how clark chooses to portray this act of finding solace as something bizarre and sinister by demonstrating the way tumblr “radicalises” angelica, violet and dolly to commit an unspeakable crime. yes, horrible corners of tumblr exist, yes, the internet is a cesspit, yes, it can exacerbate violent tendencies, yes, oversharing online might not be the best way for troubled teens to navigate mental health issues. i don’t want to deny any of that. but as someone of “was a lonely teen who sought out community in online spaces” experience, i do feel a little defensive over this portrayal! it’s not all bad! sometimes it can be joyful and beautiful to find yourself amongst people who understand you! i grew up alongside my internet friends, many of whom are still in my life, and they have taught me so much about community and connection. i guess it makes me upset to see all the negative aspects of The Tumblr Experience heightened and intensified because it leads to such a horrific murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANYWAY. credit where credit’s due: the book is extremely compelling and gripping, to the point where i read it for 2.5 hours straight on the plane and then immediately got to my hotel and continued reading it. but i think the content of it just wasn’t for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello! it’s taken me a while to write this one, and parts of it were written weeks apart. i hope it doesn’t read too chaotically, but then again, chaos is part of the M.O. of this newsletter so let’s just roll with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;part of the reason i was struggling to write this instalment was that i had half an essay written on julien baker’s music, which was all about the difficulty of being in relation when you’re suffering and how hard it is to honestly hold yourself to account for the pain you cause others in that state and how you have to keep striving towards having hope in change even as you feel like nothing could ever change—and then ATEEZ released their latest album about being gay anarchist cowboys on the run and i immediately lost my mind and went feral over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what i’m trying to say is that i’ve been yo-yoing between two very different emotional states, which are, as always, expressed very literally and directly through the music i’ve been listening to. and i didn’t want to come down on the side of either one by choosing which one to write about here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so instead, here’s a song i’ve been listening to a lot the past couple of days: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5ihS6UUlyQAfmp48eSkxuQ?si=6b84a670c9204381&quot;&gt;landslide&lt;/a&gt; by fleetwood mac. i went to see my brother graduate last week, which made me cry, out of pride for him and how hard he’s worked to get here, out of the tenderness of seeing these kids so happy with their achievement and their loved ones all coming to support them. it made me think a lot about my own graduation, five years ago now, and how i felt then and how much is different now and how little of that change i’ve been able to predict. (&lt;em&gt;can i sail through the changing ocean tides? / can i handle the seasons of my life?&lt;/em&gt;) that degree was one of the hardest things i’ve ever done and yet i was also so anxious and unsure about what the future would hold (&lt;em&gt;i climbed a mountain and i turned around&lt;/em&gt;). still, i remember standing on the senate house lawn with lydia, alex, dorothy, saskia, surina and holly, feeling so proud to have gone through the years with them. i remember lola and martha and jun coming to meet me with flowers and the joy i felt. as someone who hates change, it’s comforting to look back and realise that so many of the people who were around me that day are still in my life, despite everything that’s changed over the years. and yet, through those changes, i have met people who have become part of my heart and soul, and i wouldn’t trade that for anything either. i guess that’s what i love about this song: it understands that change is scary, change is difficult, but also that it’s inevitable. and there’s hope in that, if you have the courage to step forward. (&lt;em&gt;well i’ve been afraid of changing / cause i built my life around you / but time makes you bolder / even children get older / and i’m getting older too)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ever since i booked flights to egypt to visit elete in a frenzy of elation during one of our ridiculously long phone calls, the excitement of finally being able to see the pyramids in real life has been frothing inside me. no pictures could prepare me how for it feels to step out onto the sand at giza and walk among the pyramids. they tower over you, these monuments to kings, symbols of a might and power that has since long diminished. but looking at them, you feel the weight of such dominant authority, that could engineer the creation of such incredible structures, pull them out of nothing, to still stand tall thousands of years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as elete pointed out, the pyramids aren’t perfect, polished structures—their outer limestone casings have been removed over the centuries, leaving them with a slightly stepped look. but we felt that it adds to their impressiveness, the fact that they look constructed. you can’t help but think of the labour that hundreds of thousands of people put into building them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we got to go into one of the pyramids, the pyramid of menkaure, through a little bribery (we did not have the correct tickets but what we did have was elete’s skills in arabic and persuasion). for all its grandness, the inside is small. you descend a steep shaft into a few linked chambers. none of the riches buried with the pharaoh remain, and it’s hard to imagine the plain stone rooms as they once must have been, stuffed with all the essentials for a king to pass into the afterlife. still, it was incredible to be actually inside a pyramid, imagining the tons of stone that rest above you. what a stunning feat of architecture it is to have those rooms still be intact five thousand years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;elete told me that her mum cried when she saw all the pyramids together in panorama, and honestly, i could have done the same. partly because of their majesty and splendour; they are simply beautiful to look at. but also because i kept thinking about how many people we saw around us marvelling at the same sight that afternoon—how many people have had the same feeling of wonder through the years, centuries, millennia. there’s something moving about knowing that i’ve shared this experience with countless others. no matter who you are, everyone wants to see the pyramids. and everyone feels something, gazing up at them. it’s something that unifies us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as i type this, i have the final episodes of &lt;em&gt;demon slayer: the swordsmith village arc&lt;/em&gt; waiting for me, and i am unbelievably excited because this series keeps getting better and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the action takes place in a secret village where swordsmiths labour to create swords for the demon slayer corps. tanjiro, having just woken from a coma induced by his injuries from his last battle, barely takes a moment to rest before he’s off to go ask for a new sword to replace his damaged one. the pattern of the last two arcs continues, with two new hashira on the scene—muichiro tokito and mitsuri kanroji. no time for long introductions, though: we’re given approximately two episodes of breathing space before disaster strikes the village in the form of the upper four and upper five demons. and they mean business!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;upper four immediately splits into 4 emotions, each with a gruesome power. a spectacular strike by tanjiro nearly defeats them, in an animation sequence that i literally can’t stop thinking about, where he creates a dragon out of flame, and upper four recoils in fear, seeing within him the ancestral sun breather who once nearly defeated the lord of all demons, muzan. through sheer force of will, tanjiro is stepping into his power, learning what he’s truly capable of.  that’s my son!!! it’s a truly incredible feat, but of course it’s not enough. the demon has several other tricks up its sleeve: all of the emotions morph into one, and it’s…hatred! (kind of hilarious, kind of iconic choice there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now let’s talk about tokito, the mist hashira, who is introduced to us as he bullies a small kid into giving him the key to an automaton for training. what an asshole, am i right? wrong, because actually he’s lost all his memories and also his ability to relate to others due to being severely traumatised by—you guessed it, the events of his childhood, including his relationship with his twin brother. when i found that out, it was curtains for me i’m afraid. but what moved me the most about tokito is that tanjiro’s entreaty to him (“everything good you do for others comes back to you in the end”) sparks change in him almost immediately. all it took was one phrase and suddenly he’s diverting off-course to protect the very same kid he was bullying earlier and another swordsmith. and through his battle with the upper five demon, tanjiro’s comment comes true: if you put your heart into doing good, others will recognise that and do the same for you. it’s what keeps us going, keeps us connected. and by doing so, tokito recovers his memory of his father, another selfless man, and of what happened to him and his family. all while slaying an upper rank demon in the coolest way possible (“you think you’re the only one who hasn’t been taking this seriously?” THAT! IS! MY! SON!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;other memorable characters include the love hashira, lady kanroji (my tender-hearted strong queen with a voracious appetite searching for her place in the world! our ray of hope! the perfect marriage of steel conviction and soft malleability!), genya (who gave that traumatised kid a gun?!?!?) and the swordsmith haganezuka (so dedicated to his work that he literally loses an eye and carries on filing away at a sword).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also, i love how we’re getting more hints about the overall backstory. we finally meet the other upper rank demons and upper one looks…exactly like the swordsman from tanjiro’s dreams, the infamous sun breather whose characteristics he’s slowly taking on. and tokito’s father, who is descended from one of the first breathers, has the same red eyes as tanjiro. i need to know more and i need to know NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to summarise: this arc is about slaying demons, the power of collective action, knowing your history and respecting workers. let’s fucking go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;still very much in my rereading era, i reread &lt;em&gt;a room with a view&lt;/em&gt; which is a perfect novel and a delight. i love how sincere it is, how well it depicts what a mess our emotions can be, how funny it is, how much it believes in the endurance of love, how the characters learn how to say Yes to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also just finished rereading &lt;em&gt;emma&lt;/em&gt;, which was my favourite jane austen as a teen, although pride and prejudice has definitely stolen its crown now. what i liked so much about it when i was younger is emma’s characterisation. i like that now too! it’s a real talent to create a character who is so deeply and obviously flawed but still show so much authorial affection towards her. much of emma’s behaviour is also unfortunately deeply relatable to teen me (and maybe also to me now, if i’m being totally honest): the way she deludes herself into thinking she has intimate knowledge of everyone else’s thoughts/actions, saying the wrong thing, taking the joke too far, being way too opinionated, constructing intricate narratives in her head but failing to understand her own behaviour. i also like that, while she gains some self-awareness and tries to make amends, ultimately she doesn’t change &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much throughout the narrative. sometimes you can be sort of insufferable and still find love! someone can see all your flaws and still think: yeah, that’s the girl for me. isn’t that beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hugging elete after months apart! snorkelling through a coral reef and seeing the most beautiful fish. the huge full moon rising over the sea at night. elete and her inflatable float. staying in “the elite residence”. driving through the sinai hills. the treasures in the egyptian museum. seeing tutankhamun’s gold funeral mask. meeting elete’s juice man and drinking his fresh strawberry and guava juice. fava bean falafel. yemeni stews. koshary. seeing the nile at sunrise. playing bananagrams. watching succession together (more on this another time). sitting on my sofa with marisa talking for hours; how warm and comfortable it felt. claire in their pink cowboy boots at the wine bar. henry cooking us delicious food. eating fresh marmalade on toast on claire and henry’s balcony. hayley sending me the BTS fanchant from yoongi’s singapore show. playing cricket in the warm summer evening with my nine-year-old cousin. listening to his literary criticism. watching daughters at the outdoor cinema with arenike. sarah and i’s spontaneous food instagram creation after 2 tins and half a bottle of wine. siyang and howard spotting ateez posters in berlin and sending me photos. eating delicious thai food at singburi with lydia and seeing the sun set after 9pm. ethiopian food with agnes. cooking with audrey. listening back to the BTS conversation hayley and i had in december. my seedlings growing on the balcony. &lt;a href=&quot;https://meerschweinchen1993.tumblr.com/post/682355040457981952/wendy-xu&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by wendy xu. &lt;a href=&quot;https://firstfullmoon.tumblr.com/post/718042309342707712/that-thing-that-happens-sometimes-where-the&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by christopher citro. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/58170/every-job-has-a-first-day&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by rebecca gayle howell. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/90187/elemental-57992a13217b7&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by joanna klink. the pure happiness i felt seeing hayley for the first time in real life and being able to talk and laugh together in person. taking them around seven sisters in the matching t-shirts i bought for us while lugging a huge red suitcase. the absolute joy and peace of being with surina in the mountains again. the sense of achievement of carrying everything we needed to survive for a week on our backs. laughing so hard we had to stop walking. our freaky mind-melding where we began to say the exact thoughts the other one was having. being once again adopted by a fatherly figure. breathing the air of the pine forests. walking up through a cloudy valley until the sunlight burst through. swimming in the freshest, coldest mountain waters. sunrise on the peaks. waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you for reading. see you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello and welcome to another month in crazy town (my mind). it’s been hard going, but i’m trying, and i’m still here. i hope the longer spring days are bringing more joy to you—and if not joy, then at least some kind of peace. thinking of you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5fj32MKLHkut2Vod1UodcU&quot;&gt;AMYGDALA&lt;/a&gt; by agust d. i’m not sure that i have the words to write about this song but i owe yoongi an apology for ever doubting him. this is one of the rawest songs i’ve ever listened to: a meditation on the impossibility of continuing to carry all of the pain you’ve felt, but the equal impossibility of being able to erase it. (anne carson: You remember too much / my mother said to me recently. / Why hold onto all that? And I said, / Where can I put it down?) the difficulty of trying to set yourself free and realising that it’s not a single act of letting go, but something more constant and continual. as hayley said, the whole agust d movie trilogy is ultimately not about being able to kill your trauma once and for all, it’s about continuing to kill it as a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen (tv)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here is my elevator pitch for trigun stampede, a tv show that ate my brain, rearranged my insides, and is (clearly) still causing me severe mental anguish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tragic brothers. space western. gay as hell. religious imagery. insane animation. philosophical musings on what it means to be good and whether we can be forgiven our sins. questions include: is being a pacifist in a violent world morally right, or even possible at all? how can we find absolution when we will always carry our past with us in some way? can, and should, you try to save everyone? why? why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;obviously this is a cocktail of ingredients designed to make me, specifically, insane, but i do think there is something for everyone to enjoy in trigun. anyway, i’ve attempted to outline exactly what makes me feel so crazed about this show and the characters. spoilers ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the story takes place on the planet no man’s land, a totally inhospitable landscape that is only able to support life through the use of generators called plants, which produce water/power/other essentials. the plants are only located in a few towns/cities, meaning they are very precious, even more so because more and more of them are breaking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my engines started revving as soon as we meet our hero, vash the stampede, happy-go-lucky guy who really hates fighting please please please don’t make him fight listen he’ll just run away and everything will be fine, except when it comes down to it and he needs to protect people, can whip out a gun and destroy several hundred bombs with a single shot. however, what really got me was the moment where vash is asked, “what are you afraid of?” as he’s caught trying to sneak out of town after this heroic feat, and vash looks away and says, “i have a brother.” HELLO!!! that is the good shit right there!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to be clear, i love my own brother very much. but i also absolutely love when complex sibling relationships are portrayed well, with all the joy and tragedy that comes from such an intense bond with another person. showing how growing up with someone, learning about the world alongside them, marks you, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the reason vash is so afraid of his brother is that 150 years ago, a host of spaceships travel away from earth to colonise other planets. vash and his twin brother nai are living on one ship, along with the woman who raised them rem. a terrible crash happens, caused by nai, and facilitated by vash giving nai the access codes to the navigational systems. this ends up being the reason why humanity is stranded on no man’s land, using the remains of the shipwrecks to build towns and settlements, and relying on the plants to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;why did nai do it? well, it turns out that plants are not just generators but interdimensional beings. vash and nai are “independent” plants, meaning that they are able to live outside of the reactors that other plants are kept in. nai harbours intense anger about the way humans have trapped plants, whilst vash thinks that there’s no way plants can survive without humans taking care of them. after the crash, they go their separate ways, but are brought back into conflict with one another as the plants begin failing across the planet. nai, now going by the ridiculous moniker “millions knives” sends genetically modified gunmen after vash to entrap him, including one called nicholas d. wolfwood, who is also a priest and carries his gun as a huge wrapped cross on his back, and obviously vash is super gay for him despite knowing that wolfwood is going to betray him. possibly the most unhinged sentence i’ve ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. vash believes that plants and humans can live symbiotically together; nai believes humans must be wiped out so that plants can take over the planet. to do this, he needs vash. in a physical sense, but also emotionally—nai cannot stand that vash doesn’t see the world as he does. which is why the vash/nai split is one that can never be reconciled. nai will always want vash to love him above everything else, to want retribution, to stand with nai against humans. but the second vash does that, he’ll stop being vash, and so it’s an impossibility. vash is always going to love humanity. he believes in people so intimately: he looks at wolfwood and says, he’s a good person, i see it in his eyes. he smiles when wolfwood tells him he’ll kill vash if anything happens to the orphanage wolfwood grew up in, because it’s an affirmation of that belief—that people are fundamentally motivated by goodness. vash is never going to want to cause anyone pain. even though violence might be justified, he won’t do it. partly because of his nature, and partly because of how he believes that he has already done too much violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vash carries the guilt of being responsible for the crash with him. he carries the guilt of abandoning nai with him. he carries the guilt of every single person he’s failed to save with him. he can’t put any of it down. in one scene, he’s shown running while the hands of the dead claw him back. it’s exquisitely painful to watch someone try and try and try to do the impossible: to find absolution for an act they themselves believe to be unforgiveable. because you will never succeed. you will always come up wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and yet vash has been trying to atone for 150 years. at this point it’s a reflex to put himself in harm’s way, to undergo pain in service of others. there’s the tragedy of it: he wants to run, to escape, and yet he will never be able to, because he will always stop to help. he’ll always turn and go back when he’s needed. he learned that early on, when he realised he could heal the dying plants. that’s what he believes he’s good for, where he gets his self-worth from: saving others. or trying to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but you can’t save everyone, which is something wolfwood knows well, something he tries to convince vash of. he says to vash, “did you think trying to sacrifice yourself would make everybody happy?” maybe this is the first time someone has ever wanted more from vash than what he can do for them. maybe this is the first time someone has ever implied that vash’s own happiness and well-being might make someone happy. maybe the first time someone has wanted vash to stay alive for his own sake, for who he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;whew. i feel like i exorcised something there. please watch trigun stampede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen (movie)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my favourite thing that sarah and i saw at queer east this year was a short documentary called leo &amp;amp; nymphia. it follows a drag queen called leo (nymphia on stage), and at first the documentary is focused on how he got into drag and what he does in his shows. and he’s very charming and beautiful and we get to see how he becomes bolder and more playful in drag, how inventive he is. but the moment the documentary elevated itself for me was a shot in the mirror where we suddenly see the cameraman, who is also the director. and then we learn about him, how he’s the same age as leo and he’s always been a very socially conscious upstanding student who makes films about, like, garbage cleanup. but when he saw some of nymphia’s videos, he wanted to film her. it gives the documentary this truly intimate feel—we’re now aware that we’re seeing nymphia and leo through the eyes of someone desperate to understand another person’s transformation. the final scenes are of leo doing the director’s makeup and helping him wear drag for the first time—and the director goes to his mother’s house to show her. this blew me away, honestly. a beautiful portrayal of curiosity about the way someone else lives freely, the desire of wanting that for yourself, and then the courage to actually try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as compensation for me forcing sarah to participate in my rewatch of trigun stampede (yes i watched it twice within 2 weeks. no further questions), i resumed watching demon slayer: the entertainment district arc. what an incredible 11-episode arc. i was gripped from start to finish. the animation is stunning, but i love the journey we’re taken on here. a mystery demon in the entertainment district! our three plucky boys volunteering to join the hashira uzui tengen (who is insane) to smoke her out and kill her! at first it’s all hee-hee ha ha with silly dress-up scenes and tanjiro annoying the fuck out of the house mistress by being too good at being a servant and tengen screaming at them i’m the god of flashiness!!! worship and praise me!!! i’m a glamorous ladies man with three wives!!, but the fun and games ends when we realise this is an upper rank demon (upper six) we’re dealing with. then it’s fight scene after fight scene interspersed with traumatic backstory, because—as we all know—it always goes right back to childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in some ways the greatest animes are all about loss and grief and how we carry them. the violent death of tanjiro’s family is a touchstone for him, and that’s hammered home here, when he is powered into action by seeing upper six cut off the arm of an innocent civilian. he will not suffer any more loss or death. he simply can’t. it is not an option. and so he must fight. and nezuko (his younger sister) is the same. for the first time we see her actually use the full extent of her powers, and it’s because she’s angry and terrified that tanjiro has been hurt beyond repair by the demon. she too, cannot face losing him. she’s already lost so much. and tengen… man. his backstory actually ripped me apart. raised in a strict and brutal shinobi family, he watched as his father worked his other siblings to death in service of becoming perfect killing machines. instead of following the same path as his father, he escapes with his wives and vows to try to outweigh the lives he’s previously taken. breaking the cycle of intergenerational trauma? in my opinion, that’s the flashiest move someone could ever make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the battle with the upper six demon is long and one of the most gripping anime sequences i’ve ever seen—the animation is stunning, the rise and fall of the fight had me gasping, and through it all i had no idea how things were going to go. the moment where inosuke is stabbed through the heart, zenitsu has been crushed by a building, tengen is lying poisoned on the ground with his arm lopped off, and tanjiro has just fallen off a roof??? literally how the hell do they come back from that??? but come back they do, and it’s so unbelievably satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but the point where the demons are defeated is actually one of the quietest moments in the whole show. there’s no triumph to it. we have seen the toll that the battle has taken on our heroes. we know how close they have come to defeat, and we have seen what it has taken from them. i love fantasy/sci-fi that is aware of how fighting evil changes you; how even in victory there is a darkness that cannot be eluded. the burden of giving everything to a fight is not one that can be lifted lightly. some hurts do not heal. so it’s not satisfying because they win. it’s satisfying because although it has cost them almost everything, they did it anyway. there was simply nothing else that could be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also really liked how agency was emphasised in this arc. tengen’s choice to escape his family background turns him into a hero. he takes a path that nobody expects him to, and he walks it with grace. similarly, tanjiro has chosen to be a demon slayer, which causes the scar on his forehead (a sign that the bearer is a sun breather) to grow. what a perfect detail! he is becoming a hero, wielding the oldest and most powerful breathing technique, out of his own will. nothing is pre-destined. fate is something we can, and do, change. starting now, things are gonna get real flashy!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m back to slowly making my way through the grundrisse. i read a couple of other political economy books in the last month (monopoly capital by baran &amp;amp; sweezy, and value chains by intan suwandi) and honestly, not to be a marxpilled loser but they have nothing on marx. don’t get me wrong! they’re valuable texts, and i’m glad to have read them, particularly monopoly capital. but the way marx breaks things down to basics and comprehensively analyses every aspect of a situation is unparalleled. yes, it is sometimes difficult to follow and hard to understand—but grappling with capitalism, a political economy that shrouds itself in opacity, is never going to be a walk in the park. that’s why i appreciate the comprehensiveness of marx’s approach, how he dedicates himself to analysing and taking down his contemporaries. only through grasping the whole can you start to deal with the particulars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, here’s a part from it that i really like. marx begins with a quote from adam smith, a bourgeois political economist, and goes on to critique his position on labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Equal quantities of labour must at all times and in all places have the same value for the worker. In his normal state of health, strength and activity, and with the common degree of skill and facility which he may possess, he must always give up the identical portion of his tranquillity, his freedom, and his happiness. Whatever may be the quantity or composition of the commodities he obtains in reward of his work, the price he pays is always the same. Of course, this price may buy sometimes a lesser, sometimes a greater quantity of these commodities, but only because their value changes, not the value of the labour which buys them. Labour alone, therefore, never changes its own value. It is therefore the real price of commodities, money is only their nominal value.’ In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou labour! was Jehovah’s curse on Adam. And this is labour for Smith, a curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Tranquillity’ appears as the adequate state, as identical with ‘freedom’ and ‘happiness’. It seems quite far from Smith’s mind that the individual, ‘in his normal state of health, strength, activity, skill, facility’, also needs a normal portion of work, and of the suspension of tranquillity. Certainly, labour obtains its measure from the outside, through the aim to be attained and the obstacles to be overcome in attaining it. But Smith has no inkling whatever that this overcoming of obstacles is in itself a liberating activity – and that, further, the external aims become stripped of the semblance of merely external natural urgencies, and become posited as aims which the individual himself posits – hence as self-realization, objectification of the subject, hence real freedom, whose action is, precisely, labour. He is right, of course, that, in its historic forms as slave-labour, serf-labour, and wage-labour, labour always appears as repulsive, always as external forced labour; and not-labour, by contrast, as ‘freedom, and happiness’. […] Really free working, e.g. composing, is at the same time precisely the most damned seriousness, the most intense exertion. The work of material production can achieve this character only (1) when its social character is posited, (2) when it is of a scientific and at the same time general character, not merely human exertion as a specifically harnessed natural force, but exertion as subject, which appears in the production process not in a merely natural, spontaneous form, but as an activity regulating all the forces of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone may castigate and flagellate himself all day long like the monks etc., and this quantity of sacrifice he contributes will remain totally worthless. The natural price of things is not the sacrifice made for them. This recalls, rather, the pre-industrial view which wants to achieve wealth by sacrificing to the gods. There has to be something besides sacrifice. The sacrifice of tranquillity can also be called the sacrifice of laziness, unfreedom, unhappiness, i.e. negation of a negative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yes! there has to be something besides sacrifice! this overcoming of obstacles is in itself a liberating activity! say that! marx is clear that this is not the case for serf/slave/wage labour, but i love that he also emphasises that there is work and meaningful activity to be done that can bring satisfaction. it will take effort, it will mean exertion, it will mean the most damned seriousness. but to have a purpose, to sacrifice laziness, unfreedom, unhappiness—that’s what work will be when we are truly free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello. long time no see. to be honest, i have been (and am) very depressed. for a while that manifested as being too overwhelmed and stressed to have coherent thoughts on anything. and then a switch flipped and suddenly my head was entirely devoid of any thoughts whatsoever, which was overwhelming in a different way. i’ve been taking life at a slower pace these days, and slowly thoughts are coming back. i wanted to share some of them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently yoongi of BTS announced his upcoming solo album. as the release date approaches, he’s been talking about the things that motivated him to write music in the past (anger, confrontation) and how that’s changed now, saying that he’s become mellow. this is why i fear, despite yoongi’s undeniable talent, that i will not enjoy this solo album. no disrespect to yoongi, nor to anyone else who has found peace and contentment and uses those emotions for creative inspiration—also thinking here about rina sawayama’s latest album, which is all about how she’s been to therapy and is healing her inner child. unfortunately, my inner child is bad vibes and unpleasant to be around, so i can’t get involved with all that. i am interested only in people who are sick in the head mining their pain and misery to write songs for listeners who are also sick in the head (me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seriously, though, music is the one creative art where i need people to be therapising themselves through the process of creating, not coming to creation in a new, happy, post-therapy state. i don’t feel the same way about art, or novels, or tv, or movies. but there’s something about the lyrical release that a song gives you that, for me, needs to be about tapping into those emotions you might be ashamed of, or wish you never felt, or don’t understand. it allows for a safe kind of vulnerability. being seen to feel deranges you, says anne carson. but if i raise my voice to join to yours in the song, i am protected by the knowledge that someone else has felt it too. the songs i keep coming back to are those that don’t hide those feelings, don’t paper them over with platitudes. it’s a hand outstretched in the darkness. one that reaches into the gaping maw at the heart of you, pulls out everything you think is wrong about yourself, and sets it loose. music offers that kind of catharsis like nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;needless to say, the soundtrack of my last month has been the newest fall out boy album. i have so much more to say about this album and rest assured, i’ll be sharing those thoughts at some point, but for now let me leave you with my favourite deranged feeling tracks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/72FVwjVBxIiSxz5QpGRlww?si=329c510bf6324fe8&quot;&gt;so much (for) stardust&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;i used to be a real go-getter / i used to think it’d all get better.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4fEKtGayGb3xsbvGbihAoK?si=1e3e9c3c64f34576&quot;&gt;the kintsugi kid (ten years).&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;i know i’m not your intended dose / we’re going low low low.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/325pIhoHocYWIMMi5Ik2UB?si=0d7a92050d7047f6&quot;&gt;fake out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;we did it for futures that never came / and for pasts we’re never gonna change / buried alive inside my dreams but it was all a fake-out / and i don’t care, i just gotta figure out a window to break out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve also been listening to maggie rogers’ latest album, which i shamefully let fly over my head when it was released in july, possibly because i wasn’t in my feelings enough then. but i spent an entire car journey listening to it on repeat and it has rewired my brain. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1cncEDS6zwXOguyaMGp6vU?si=c1686f67cb124188&quot;&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;? she went off with that one. &lt;em&gt;i see horses running wild and i wish i could feel like that for just a minute?&lt;/em&gt; girl, same. the bit in the middle where she just starts full-on wailing_?_ girl…SAME. &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1zoPdnExrABr51QDrEoZUQ?si=358d8692cff24e69&quot;&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; also has its foot on my neck: &lt;em&gt;i started out trying to do what’s right / but i lost it all in the middle of the night.&lt;/em&gt; woof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;side-note: since i wrote the above, yoongi’s music video trailer dropped, wherein he is seen beating someone to a pulp. there’s hope after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have been unable to read anything new for the last month, instead turning to some of my favourite books to soothe my depressed brain. here’s what’s been comforting me lately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the earthsea cycle&lt;/em&gt; by ursula k. le guin. (re)reading these four stories is like drinking fresh water from a stream or finding a rock that fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. they are so profound but in the plainest, most simple way. everything feels right and true and real. you get the sense that things are happening as they must. that there is purpose to the world, and living in it. there is work to be done and people who are willing do it. it isn’t easy: light and darkness come together. people make mistakes. evil is done and harm happens, purposefully or not. but there will always be light. hurts can be healed. the tombs can be escaped. friends will go with you to the farthest shore, and you will come back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i found rereading &lt;em&gt;tehanu&lt;/em&gt; particularly moving this time, being as it is a story about hurt and healing, and losing your purpose in the world, and finding your way back to being. here’s a quote from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arha was taught that to be powerful she must sacrifice. Sacrifice herself and others. A bargain: give, and so get. And I cannot say that that’s untrue. But my soul can’t live in that narrow place—this for that, tooth for tooth, death for life…. There is a freedom beyond that. Beyond payment, retribution, redemption—beyond all the bargains and the balances, there is freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the lord of the rings&lt;/em&gt; by j. r. r. tolkien_._ i watched the return of the king a couple of weeks ago, which cleaved me clean in two as always, and then i was like, i MUST reread lotr right NOW. i found it wildly emotional. éowyn’s defiance, faramir’s grace, gandalf’s trust. the loyalty and devotion of the hobbits. &lt;em&gt;i can’t carry it for you, but i can carry you.&lt;/em&gt; the fact that the defeat of sauron will mean the loss of grace and beauty and splendour on middle earth—and yet it must be done. i love that the world is worth saving even though it is in decline. i love that there is always a star in the sky, that they cannot conquer forever. i love the pity and honour and faith and fidelity that abounds. and, i love, of course, frodo’s journey and his final stand, there at the end of all things. he carried too much, he went beyond the limits of his endurance. the burden he was put under was impossible. and yet nobody else could have done it, and so he had to do it. and he is a hero. and most importantly, he was never alone. this story will forever be a core part of my being and so, so important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;watership down&lt;/em&gt; by richard adams. truly one of my favourite books of all time. it’s the banding together of an unlikely group of characters to go on a journey of epic proportions! the courage! the spirit! the refusal to give up! being swift and full of tricks! fighting for freedom! the way they each find their own strength of character and come to rely on each other! defying all odds to find a place to call home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;our mutual friend&lt;/em&gt; by charles dickens. my toxic trait is that i think dickens slaps and nobody can convince me otherwise. this is my favourite of his books, and it remains a delightful soap opera romp of a story, packed with wry observations, memorable characters and moments that are simply screamingly funny. yes, it can be frustrating sometimes that dickens got paid by the word but 1) my boy has to eat and 2) it allows him to fully commit to the bit. more seriously, i find the way he writes about victorian london and the extreme poverty and deprivation people were living in very moving. he has deep empathy for their struggles and fiercely condemns the state institutions that profited from the exploitation of both the proletariat and the lumpenproletariat. that’s what i really love about dickens: he understands the ridiculousness of this life, but also treats it with the gravity it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; by andrew sean greer. this is simply a lovely book. it’s funny and ridiculous and has such a big heart that it’s impossible not to be moved by it. it says, yes, you might be deep in your flop era. yes, you might be suffering humiliation after mishap after disaster. and yet life can still surprise you. happiness is not bullshit. and the love is always there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;last seen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently i finished &lt;em&gt;my school president,&lt;/em&gt; a thai high school BL show (yes, another one). initially i wasn’t sold on it. the plot of the first episode is chaotic to say the least. gun, a senior, is finally head of music club. immediately he comes up against disaster: the school principal hates music club for some reason! but the only person with the power to actually cancel the club is… the school president. so gun runs to be school president, losing to our other protagonist: quiet stern boy tinn, who happens to be the principal’s son and seems to share her dislike of music club. at this point i’m going, “OK i see how it is, we’ve engineered a random enemies-to-lovers plotline out of nowhere, YAWN”. however, episode 2 turns this dynamic completely on its head by revealing that tinn has actually had a bonkers insane crush on gun for YEARS and the only reason he’s run for school president is to push gun’s band to get better by being a villain that motivates them to win competitions, practise hard, etc. he’s crazy and i love it!!! much like another favourite show of mine, the untamed, it asks the question: what if our quiet icy boy is actually tapped? what if the real reason he’s so harsh on our bubbly enthusiastic boy is because he’s clinically obsessed with him? this is much-needed representation for delusional girls everywhere. and the reason i love tinn is because he follows through on his delusions! he actualises them through sheer will-power—and a LOT of support from his long-suffering, also gay as hell best friend, tiw. (side-note: all of tiw’s scenes and particularly his flirty subplot with por, the pianist of the band, are incredible. no notes. 10000/10.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, as the show progresses tinn quickly loses his ability to be a baddie, because he’s actually just a sweet boy who wants to be gun’s wife sooooo badly. literally all he wants is to support gun, love him, motivate him to reach his dreams, and take care of him. gay people make me sick for real!!! and ofc gun soon starts opening up to tinn, and relying on him, and one thing leads to another…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my favourite essay on any piece of media ever is erica cantoni’s short piece on friday night lights. in it, she says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of shows I ask everyone I talk to about television if they have seen: &lt;em&gt;The Wire, Mad Men, Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt;. But when I ask them if they’ve watched and loved &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt;, what I mean is &lt;em&gt;are you my kind of person?&lt;/em&gt; Are you all heart? Are you bothered by this 21st-century lack of earnestness, our abundance of irony? Do you wonder how we forgive and coach ourselves to do better? How we can strive again for valor and loyalty and daring and redemption? I fear we are defaulting to needless negativity as some kind of social currency. But &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights&lt;/em&gt; is the most earnest show I’ve ever watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that’s how i felt watching my school president. this show is all heart. all about portraying a steady, warm first love where two people try so hard to do right by each other. to take care of each other, to be there. they are teens figuring things out, so of course there are conflicts and miscommunications and aches, but these are always resolved within the arc of an episode. i would say that the show does veer a little too far into sentimentality (particularly the prom episode) but hey. i forgive it for that. sometimes we could all do with a bit of excess sentimentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finally, this quote from hanif abdurraqib’s essay on fall out boy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acknowledgement of that which we all spend a lifetime searching for: the permission to come home again, after forgetting that there are still people who will show up to love you, no matter how long you’ve been away. No matter how obsessed you’ve been with your own vanishing, there will always be someone who still wants you whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you for still being here with me. see you soon, i hope. take care of yourselves and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! it feels simultaneously like february is slipping through my fingers and also like we are never going to make it to spring. but the other day i stopped on the steps of the tate in the late afternoon and i thought, &lt;em&gt;hey, it’s still light out&lt;/em&gt;. a small gratitude but gratitude all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as some of you may know, this is my year of starting to learn chinese again, so that if i ever meet my ancestors in the afterlife i can say more than the sum total of my remembered gcse mandarin phrases: &lt;em&gt;hello, i love you&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;i live in england&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;because sport is good for your health, every tuesday and thursday i play tennis with my friends,&lt;/em&gt; like the world’s most boring game of two truths and a lie. anyway so far this goal has not manifested beyond me deciding to get into a spotify hole of chinese music. i was going to say “obscure” there, but i genuinely have no idea whether these songs are popular or, in fact, literally anything about them beyond finding them fun to listen to. i kind of enjoy the mystery tbh! more motivation to hit the books and learn some characters so i can actually recognise the names of the songs. here are some songs i’ve found along this journey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i finished happy valley season 2 in a week which is the fastest i’ve watched tv in a long while. when i tell people that it’s incredibly comforting to watch, they usually look at me like i’ve got two heads (jun’s housemates found it “perturbing”) but it is! yes, it deals with incredibly fucked up events and there are a lot of distressing  scenes. and yet it’s threaded through with moments of warmth and humour. arenike said that it’s a show that is about what it means to love people, and i couldn’t agree more. it considers so deeply how we can love each other, even through terrible tragedy, even though sometimes loving people can cause unimaginable pain. it doesn’t necessarily mean forgiveness or absolution. and it doesn’t always mean kindness. but it means holding on. it means saying to people: i’m here, and i’m not going anywhere. that’s the gift catherine gives to the people around her—her family, her colleagues, the people she meets every day. she refuses to give up on them. there’s nobody more empathetic or willing to give second chances. but the nuance of the show is that even catherine has her limits. taking care of ryan—loving him—means she confronts those every day. that’s an incredibly difficult thing to capture on screen, and the show pulls it off masterfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scenes that really got me: catherine and clare screaming at each other after helen’s funeral and catherine chasing her down the street. ryan asking daniel about whether his mum died because she got pregnant too young. catherine and alison in the hospital, and catherine saying &lt;em&gt;i’m here.&lt;/em&gt; (i could not stop crying). obviously that final scene where catherine tells clare about alison’s history, and looks to ryan. absolute chills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;over the past couple of weeks i’ve been to two classical concerts at the barbican: one with matthew, where we saw beethoven’s piano concerto no. 4 in g major, rachmaninoff’s symphonic dances and a piece by kurt weill; and the other with my dad where we saw beethoven’s fifth symphony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love seeing classical music live. one of my favourite things about university was that dorothy was in the chamber orchestra and i went to see them play their termly concerts when i could. there’s something so profoundly relaxing about sitting and watching an orchestra (or any classical ensemble) perform. my mind wanders in this expansive, lovely way. possibilities open up. i feel creative and free. the classical pieces i’m drawn to are ones that have this sense of optimism and vitality to them. triumph, if you will, but not always a dramatic one. sometimes triumph is the final movement of beethoven’s fifth, which makes me feel like i can do absolutely anything. but sometimes triumph is quieter, more internal: sitting and feeling like you’ve just experienced hope made manifest in sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just finished reading dinosaurs by lydia millet. this could have been a great novel. it has all the things i love: people figuring how to live with each other, people recovering from heartbreak, people trying to live right. but the narrative style was just tooooo derivative of annie proulx for me to really relax into it, and the story itself just too obvious in places. it needed more subtlety and a bit more shades of grey, but i guess it was trying its best. also, liberal authors remain unable to satisfyingly analyse trump’s america beyond the most broad and basic brushstroke analysis. still, it had a certain charm. one of the protagonist’s best friends is introduced briefly and then enters a medically induced coma, which i found moving. i think it’s a real authorial skill to provoke such care and investment in characters and their relationships in just a few scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also just finished is a collection of lenin’s writings abeera bought for me in a communist bookstore in delhi. i love reading lenin so much. there’s nobody who has such lucidity of thought and clarity of vision. he saw historical/political/economic situations as they were and managed to write about them in a way that drove (and drives) people to action. thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/spencerbeswick/status/1624433889069436929&quot;&gt;that excerp&lt;/a&gt;t from robin d. g. kelley’s work on the sharecroppers union in alabama, and a thousand other examples besides. his unrelenting belief in the inevitability of the power of the proletariat to bring revolution is contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i can sense myself hitting a reading slump guys! please recommend me something, anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the pure insanity of viareggio carnevale. saskia and i dissolving into manic laughter as soon as we saw the first giant float. discovering i like aperol spritz. the amount of bread and meats i consumed. the warm italian light on the faces of my beautiful friends! driving through the tuscan hills. the unhinged energy of us tucked into bed wearing our carnival masks. the number of flags bedecking viareggio. dorothy’s excitement at all the confetti. a beautiful, multi-course meal with the most incredible seafood and the shots of mysterious herbal liqueur we got after. being sent photos of sunsets. siyang’s homemade turnip cake. steaming whole sea bass! my baby cousin rachel saying “i love maths so much i could do it all day!” seeing the way hareem has decorated her new room and lying in her comfy armchair. visiting the maria bartuszova exhibition with lola. arenike telling me about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tate.org.uk/tate-collective/writing-and-art&quot;&gt;poetic responses&lt;/a&gt; to the lynette yiadom-boakye exhibition she commissioned. the tiny frogs jun knitted. hareem saying i remind her of her 9-month-old nephew because we both get upset when we don’t eat our daily banana. arenike cooking two beautiful curries for jun, nandini and i: the reunion of the ‘take your own advice’ group chat! sitting in the tate with alfie amongst the henry moores and talking for ages. the woman being encouraged up the climbing wall by her two daughters. getting a valentine’s day email from elete. the infinite wisdom and love and grace with which my friends hold me every day!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;see you soon. take care of yourselves out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! welcome to the final newsletter of the year! i am scheduling this to send on thursday as usual because i’m unsure of my wifi situation this week, so i hope it gets to you all okay. i’ve felt more reflective than usual as the year draws to a close. i looked back at my resolutions for 2022 and i did very few of them, but i think i’ve grown in unexpected ways this year. it has been extraordinarily hard and miserable at times, but i am proud of myself for not giving up, for refusing to lie down in the hole, for trying my best, for being brave. i’m grateful to everybody who’s held me through the year, and, okay, yeah, i’ll say it: i’m tentatively hopeful about the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i can’t lie, i have hardly listened to anything but indigo since it came out, as my spotify &lt;a href=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkBR09-XoAAEGd4?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large&quot;&gt;receiptify&lt;/a&gt; from the last month proves. but here are some other tracks that i’ve been spinning when indigo briefly releases its grip on my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/2YeteVB8F8UkB5gmRPevLm?si=ba65e696bbeb4f53&quot;&gt;paradigm&lt;/a&gt; by ATEEZ. the real life, high-volume shriek i let out when seonghwa begins this song with the lyrics &lt;em&gt;OH NEW REVOLUTION&lt;/em&gt;: undignifying. yet i refuse to be embarrassed because once again ATEEZ have delivered me a marxist (yes, i said it!) anthem about the world we can bring into being through revolutionary praxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/69NhT4N2MrEA41CJ4wdH1T?si=174b7efc71ab4a49&quot;&gt;one by one&lt;/a&gt; by LUCY. i have been dying to talk about LUCY in my newsletter, because i am obsessed with them. they’re a four-person band (yechan on violin, wonsang on bass, sangyeop on guitar, gwangil on drums) and their music is always so fresh and fun and bright. it’s impossible to feel bad while listening to them! also, you’ve heard of gay people not being able to sit in chairs properly, but wonsang takes that to a new level by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CmI-JJ0JqUL/&quot;&gt;standing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CmCClpSJHIZ/&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Clqh0LIpBEQ/&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/ClveyQtpgUC/&quot;&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/ClnhqPMpWxW/&quot;&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck2tKFpJuU9/&quot;&gt;every&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CkKMo-oJtfu/&quot;&gt;single&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CkAjCXbJD2Z/&quot;&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Cju5kNcJn8z/&quot;&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CjXXTfiJhQ0/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CiMxzYEpLZC/&quot;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CiFcz4Zpb3w/&quot;&gt;no&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CiCzo_QprCs/&quot;&gt;seriously&lt;/a&gt;). anyway, this is my current LUCY comfort song because yechan’s violin solo at 2:24 makes me feel like everything is going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/0s9aeZriwqyBYfxFzsd20R?si=6c8063df9ea44dab&quot;&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt; by the mountain goats. you know i had to do it! happy new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i took a 16 hour flight last week, so what better time to start reading &lt;em&gt;war and peace&lt;/em&gt;? i love a russian classic, but something about the commitment demanded by war and peace has always made me hesitant to start. i’m a fast reader but even so, 1400 pages means at least 2 weeks devoted to it. it’s a big project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my initial thoughts on finishing volume 1 were that it’s such a dynamic novel already. i always think that russian classics are so full of life, so unafraid to depict people in all their overdramatic indecisive complexity. scenes like the old count rostov dancing after dinner, or sonya crying in the corridor or andrey’s relief at his son’s fever breaking or nikolay gambling away his money feel so vivid and enjoyable, because they are trying to describe something real to you. i love that. i feel like so often i read novels that are saturated with authorial direction, overwrought in the way every detail has been agonised over. less of that and more writing for the joy of telling a story, for the ability to put into words something you see and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i wandered down to a tiny gallery near my grandmother’s house in kalamunda (up in the hills a short drive out of perth, but everyone acts like it’s in the middle of nowhere). there was an exhibition on by richard and una bell, &lt;em&gt;riparia&lt;/em&gt; (meaning: of, or pertaining to, a river bank). i’ll never get used to how different the wildlife is here, and the paintings honoured that beautifully. richard bell’s were more traditional landscapes (which i am always a sucker for): paintings of brooks and rivers and weirs, with their distinctive gum trees and grasses and reeds. una bell’s were a little weirder: bright colours and patterns and botanical shapes, bizarre aquatic creatures that looked right out of a fossil catalogue. it was a good reintroduction to the australian bush: familiar but strange, almost unbelievable in its wild beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;oh guys i am not feeling good about jackie aprile’s journey further into the mob and the way he’s becoming hungry for power and influence……i fear this can only end badly. same for artie and how he’s becoming ever-more entangled with tony and his crew. same for tony and his new affair with an unstable woman who will become obsessed with him. you hate to see it. it’s interesting to see christopher settle more into his role as a made man—i am excited for adriana and her club but i do miss the depths the show mined from christopher when he was still dithering about whether he wanted to be in the mafia. i hope we see more complexity in his/adriana’s storyline soon (and hopefully not of the tragic kind).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;running out of the house late at night to see the snow falling. the way it made everything brighter and more beautiful the next day. ethiopian food with martha. chinese food with siyang. chicken roasted in gochujang. lying under a blanket with claire and untangling all our thoughts. listening to them read out a poem in progress. hayley’s blog post about namjoon and indigo. the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gduuajhODOU&amp;amp;ab_channel=BANGTANTV&quot;&gt;live performances of indigo&lt;/a&gt; at dia beacon, which (surprise surprise) made me cry. hareem befriending my parents. a day of strategising with the nejma collective. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44142/messiah-christmas-portions&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by mark doty. the purple jacaranda flowers that are blooming everywhere in kalamunda. the smell of the gum trees. sun on my skin. seeing jupiter venus mars AND saturn at the same time in the night sky. reflecting on the past year with friends, and thinking about our intentions for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you so much for reading. if you have thoughts on 2022 or plans/resolutions/ideas for next year, i’d love to hear them. i’ll see you in 2023!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello. can you believe the days are still getting shorter? i don’t know why the brutality of the winter dark always surprises me like this—surely i should remember that 4pm in december feels like the middle of the night, when it happens every year. anyway, i hope you’re all surviving and managing to find joy and light where you can. everything passes, even december.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/08HCdXZVN72S2vpIT9DKhU?si=po_gWzATR8OzA-6Sl3NTFg&quot;&gt;indigo&lt;/a&gt; by RM. so here’s the thing. when i heard that kim namjoon, king of introspection, was doing his first solo album reflecting on the years 2019–2022, i thought &lt;em&gt;thank god.&lt;/em&gt; i thought, &lt;em&gt;this is going to be cathartic.&lt;/em&gt; but even with that expectation i was not prepared at all for how comprehensively this album eviscerated me. i heard the opening lines of wild flower: &lt;em&gt;open land, that’s where i’m at / no name, that’s what i have / no shame, i’m on my grave&lt;/em&gt; and started crying, which is possibly the most visceral immediate reaction i’ve had to a song. and what a song. what an album. what an incredible raw meaningful beautiful bold determined angry melancholy courageous reflexive work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this album contains all of what life is, the heartache and the hope, the bitterness and the joy, the anger and the delight—and most importantly this incredible, overwhelming resolve to survive. namjoon shows us his heart in every single track, openly, without shame. he says, i know how hard it is. i know how difficult it is to figure out who you are and who you want to be and what your dreams are. i know it’s lonely. i know it hurts. but i’m not giving up and neither should you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that resolute determination to keep going is a triumphant and beautiful thing, and the album expresses that too. &lt;em&gt;LET’S GO! / light a flowerwork.&lt;/em&gt; the first thing hayley said to me about indigo was, “he’s raging to want to live”. and he is. &lt;em&gt;life is better than death, i’ll prove it.&lt;/em&gt; namjoon is trying so hard to want to be alive, and there is joy to be found in that struggle. &lt;em&gt;i’m fighting all day / i’m living my way.&lt;/em&gt; he’s trying so hard to create, to express himself. &lt;em&gt;poetry / my one and only strength and dream. i wanna be a human before i do some art.&lt;/em&gt; he’s looking forward to the future, he’s letting go of the past, he refuses to turn back. &lt;em&gt;now you will protect you / so no, no looking back.&lt;/em&gt; even a still life moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the art he made in the process is a masterpiece: lyrically complex and sonically diverse, full of raw emotion and bold exhilaration. it feels so whole and complete as a project. listening to it makes me cry, and dance around my kitchen, and snap my fingers walking down the street in the cold december night. it makes me feel less alone. it makes me feel brave. it makes me want to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i saw &lt;em&gt;transit&lt;/em&gt; by rachel cusk in the library and got it out to reread. i read all of cusk’s outline trilogy a few years ago and the scene that most stuck in my mind was one from this book, where a man spends a few pages telling the narrator about the saluki, a breed of hunting dog. at the time, this scene stood out to me as an example of cusk at her best, or, maybe more precisely, at the pinnacle of what she was trying to achieve in these novels. but honestly i couldn’t quite remember what that aim exactly was, nor what it was about the scene that so perfectly captured it, so i thought i’d reread the book and see what i thought. and actually, overall i enjoyed the book a lot more than i did on first read—i bumped it up from four to five stars on my highly subjective, extremely chaotic goodreads rating scale. honestly, the book isn’t perfect and sometimes it can be annoying, but i think i’ve grown to appreciate how cusk has a clear vision of what she wants to achieve in these novels, and her clean, precise prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway. the novel is told through a series of conversations that the narrator has with various people: a builder, an estate agent, her ex-boyfriend, her cousin, a student who hopes to write a novel. through these conversations, each person reveals a lot about themselves, both in what they say and what they leave unsaid. the narrator herself is almost anonymous. most of the time she joins the conversation simply to ask pertinent questions to direct her interlocutor’s thoughts. it’s a clever narrative trick, one that gives the reader freedom to interpret these conversations as they like. but always, you have the sense that there is some framework behind the novel, that you are being carefully directed towards some underlying perceptive truth beneath the layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and i think that’s what is so clever about the scene where the hunting dogs are described. it occurs during a writing class the narrator is teaching. at the beginning, a student says that his dog is beautiful. another student tells him that he can’t just &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; his dog is beautiful, he has to show it. at this point the narrator steps in and asks the student for more detail about the dog. he talks for a long time about how he came to adopt this dog, about the woman who sold it to him and her experience of seeing the dogs hunt for the first time. through this telling, we of course realise the beauty of the dog. QED, right? well, yes, but i think there’s a more subtle point here that cusk is trying to make. the key is that we are able to see the dog through his eyes simply by how he talks about his personal feelings towards the dog. it’s not that he’s describing the dog in physical detail in order to make us share his feeling that the dog is beautiful. but we understand deeply why &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; believes the dog to be beautiful, and therefore we consider it beautiful too. i don’t know if i’ve managed to articulate this well; perhaps it’s a scene that needs to be read within the context of the novel. but i’m glad i reread it and tried to grasp what exactly was so memorable about that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maybe season 3 of the sopranos isn’t really what i should be watching in the final dwindling days of the year. i need comfort and joy, not watching the brutal death of one of the bada bing dancers after she gets a little too close to the increasingly unstable and volatile ralph cifaretto. honestly i can’t wait for this man to get OUT of the show (aka die). he’s so unpleasant and mean, seemingly just for the sake of it. even richie was better, something i never thought i would say. anyway, i haven’t really been able to watch again since that episode. the contrast between the 20-year-old single mom tracey’s terrible end and meadow’s mundane university problems (she finds her roommate annoying, her boyfriend breaks up with her for no reason) was quite tough to watch. it’s still really brilliant TV, don’t get me wrong, but if anyone has recommendations for something a little lighter (and to prevent me rewatching yuri on ice for the 6th time) please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay so i wrote the above on monday and then tuesday night abeera came home and we drank red wine and watched one of THE best sopranos episodes i’ve seen, the one where carmela goes to see a therapist. absolutely &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; television. i was floored. that’s the sopranos content i’ve been craving: complicated moral choices and hard conversations and people grappling with the consequences of the life they’re living. plus the scene where tony complains about the orange juice with bits in? chef’s absolute kiss. i’m hooked once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;abeera and i went to see &lt;em&gt;aftersun&lt;/em&gt; last night, in my ideal cinema setup: a 90 minute movie beginning at 6pm. the film itself was beautiful and moving, an 11-year-old being taken on holiday to a turkish resort by her young father. it’s slow-moving and restrained, but because the film itself isn’t long it doesn’t drag. i thought it was brilliant in the way it reveals details about sophie &amp;amp; her father and their lives without lots of exposition, helped by paul mescal’s incredible, sensitive acting. i was wondering whether it was perhaps too subtle, given the ending, but abeera reminded me on our way out that it being from sophie’s perspective means that it’s centred on the things she’s aware of or would pick up on. and i think if it was any more obvious it would feel over-explained and excessive. i loved the way it hints at sophie’s burgeoning sexual awakening, right on the borderline of adolescence but still childish and silly; loved all the Brits Abroad details; loved the camcorder footage. one of my favourite scenes was right after sophie drops a snorkelling mask into the sea. she apologises to her dad, saying, &lt;em&gt;i know it was expensive&lt;/em&gt;. he pauses for a few seconds, and you can see him visibly wrestling with his annoyance and frustration before choosing to be tender and kind to his daughter. i really love seeing moments where people actively try to be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saskia cooking us the most beautiful christmas meal. seeing zachary quinto on stage and alfie leaning across to whisper, “incandescent” to me (if you know you know!) ATEEZ &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; dropping their europe tour dates (relatedly: the mics are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy8nXYicUZE&amp;amp;ab_channel=ATEEZ&quot;&gt;ON&lt;/a&gt;). a reflexive, fulfilling, 3.5 hour long conversation with hayley about what BTS means to us. watching the football in the pub with dorothy. drinking red wine on the sofa with abeera. morocco beating spain on penalties. working in a bougie department store with arenike and sitting in their £6000 tan leather armchairs afterwards. hareem’s excitement at getting my christmas presents. my new purple fleece that makes me feel like a baby sheep. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42525/everything-that-acts-is-actual&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; denise levertov poem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?volume=115&amp;amp;issue=6&amp;amp;page=28&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; richard shelton poem. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57555/adieu-to-norman-bon-jour-to-joan-and-jean-paul&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; frank o’hara poem. and &lt;a href=&quot;https://poets.org/poem/poem-lana-turner-has-collapsed&quot;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt; from frank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello and welcome to volume 7. november currently has its foot on my neck so i’ve been struggling to have any thoughts at all that aren’t &lt;em&gt;oh god can somebody please remove the pins they’re stabbing into my wax doll&lt;/em&gt;, but here we are anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on repeat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a selection of songs from my ‘navigating the horrors (autumn 2022)’ playlist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/7bSJAuXjyhlTcz5CfoNDdt?si=72f17ca547ad46b5&quot;&gt;everythingoes&lt;/a&gt; by RM. i love this song for its resoluteness, the determination in the refrain (&lt;em&gt;it shall pass / everything everything everything goes&lt;/em&gt;), but also for its melancholy. no feeling is final, and there’s hope in that. but you lose something in the passing, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/0FrC9lzgVhziJenigsrXdl?si=UPo0fUs2QEiW2Z1HuR69FA&quot;&gt;jack in the box&lt;/a&gt; by j-hope. i love hobi so much and i &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; tell you exactly why if you ask me who my favourite BTS member is at a function. one thing i especially appreciate about him is that he’s never afraid to show how much effort and thought goes into everything he does. in this project he wanted to show us his darker side, the difficult feelings he’s grappling with: his fear of the future, his search for a safe place. i have been taking a lot of comfort from it over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##&lt;strong&gt;last seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on kallie’s recommendation, sarah and i went to the fundació joan miró in barcelona. the museum itself was designed specifically to host his sculptures and paintings, and it’s a delight architecturally. there are unexpected windows, terraces looking out over the city, a rooftop with sculptures hidden around every corner, nooks and crannies, staircases, rounded curves and sharp edges. i loved the feeling that the space itself was part of the curation, that someone had thought carefully about the placement of everything, down to where to add a little window so you could observe the details of a big sculpture from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the art itself was a joy! i wasn’t familiar with his work beyond a big poster alex has of his, but from that alone i knew i would like it a lot. in the first room, i couldn’t help but feel that the pieces reminded me of poems in some way (a big tarpaulin entitled &lt;em&gt;woman encircled by a flight of birds in the night&lt;/em&gt;, a painted stone) and in the very next room the description talked about miró’s paintings as poetry. i loved the way he titled works (&lt;em&gt;song on white background, the lark’s wing encircled with golden blue rejoins the heart of the poppy sleeping on the diamond-studded meadow&lt;/em&gt;), loved how he painted birds, loved his weird, often very funny sculptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there was also a paul klee exhibition on which had a lot of his sketches of the natural world, starting from his early anatomical sketches. i always find it interesting when abstract artists start from such detailed, precise beginnings, and slowly start to break the rules. love how preoccupied he was by fish and strange little creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;currently watching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sopranos has taken a much darker turn as we go into season 3. [spoilers ahead] with tony’s mother’s death (which to me was very unexpected, surprising in how anticlimactic it was), one of the principal antagonists of the first couple of seasons has gone, and i feel like the show is now beginning to explore the uglier side of the mob. the episode i just watched had a dying old man forced to try and kill someone who has been acting out, which obviously ends in extreme violence and hammers home how being part of the mafia is a duty you can never escape from or turn away from. a particularly brutal episode was dr melfi’s sexual assault and her subsequent grapple with morality over whether to tell tony about it. i hate sexual violence being used as a plot point but i think the show just gets away with it. during a time when dr melfi is struggling with why she feels compelled to keep treating tony, she goes through something incredibly traumatic, is failed by a system that supposedly keeps her safe, and therefore thinks about where she can find protection and revenge for what has happened to her. the final scene of that episode where tony asks her if he can do anything and she pauses before saying “no” gave me chills. another fairly dark plotline is the slow pull of jackie jr into the mafia despite his late father wanting a different life for him—i feel this may mirror tony’s own journey into the family business, which has only been hinted at so far. will have to wait and see if there are parallels there. oh and also artie’s marriage failing and how he’s getting into business with tony…my dad said artie was a “tragic character” and i’m beginning to sense things are only going to get worse for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also of course young royals continues to have its foot on my neck. i love these emotionally confused but ultimately communicative teens!!! when simon channels his sad feelings into his songwriting….that’s my emotionally intelligent son!!! and wille taking slow steps towards being more emotionally open and resist his mother’s authority….i know you can do it king!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the seven books i got out of the library this week was &lt;em&gt;river&lt;/em&gt; by esther kinsky, which i thought i might write about but honestly i feel like it was unfortunately simply too overtly racist for me to really comment on it in a positive light (main character visits tel aviv in the context of “searching for a place of belonging”; describes india as a “fecund country”; the race of anyone who isn’t white is always remarked on and their behaviour continually commented on in a way that i found uncomfortable and voyeuristic). hate it thanks! also imo kind of weird for fitzcarraldo editions to publish a book which affirms zionism and israel’s existence when they’ve also published &lt;em&gt;minor detail&lt;/em&gt; by adiana shibli, which expresses the painful violence of settler-colonialism so explicitly. idk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; just today i moved onto &lt;em&gt;the city and the home&lt;/em&gt; by natalia ginzburg, an epistolary novel—let’s hope i get on with this one better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! i’m back. someone (elete or hayley maybe?) once said that the year doesn’t start until lunar new year has passed, so here’s the first newsletter of the real new year. happy year of the rabbit! it’s a year of escaping demons, of running fast and free, of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kairisk.tumblr.com/post/707195561572499456/if-they-catch-you-they-will-kill-you-but-first&quot;&gt;being swift and full of tricks&lt;/a&gt;, of becoming ungovernable. let’s get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;audrey and i finished season 2 of &lt;em&gt;young royals&lt;/em&gt; and it was fantastic. i was on the edge of my seat the entire time! i thought the tension built up so perfectly; when wille stood up to give his speech after spending the entire episode having an extreme anxiety breakdown, i genuinely had no idea how it was going to go. and then when he went off script and said “fuck tradition, that was me having gay sex in that video! and i liked it!” i was shaking crying screaming throwing up. period!!! as totally ridiculous as the whole premise of this show is, what i love is that at its core it’s about letting yourself seize the love that is there for the taking; about being open and honest and loyal; about trying to do right by someone else. when simon said i love you to wille i felt it physically in my chest. no notes whatsoever! perfect television! season 3 can’t come soon enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also started watching &lt;em&gt;sherwood&lt;/em&gt;. sorry but it’s january and sometimes you just need a hit of copaganda! there’s something so profoundly relaxing and compelling about the beats of these bbc procedural shows. this one takes place in a nottinghamshire mining village, which was predominantly a UDM town during the strikes (aka breaking the NUM line and going back to work in the pits). although it’s set 30 years on, the town’s memory is long and the scars of that divisive time still haven’t healed. i’m intrigued, but also prepared to roll my eyes at whatever half-baked political analysis is inserted in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hareem and i watched &lt;em&gt;eternal sunshine of the spotless mind&lt;/em&gt; on the weekend, which i’d never seen before. i found it very moving, but in a hopeful sort of way. made me think a lot about love and loss and change and failure and trying. how loving someone else means seeing them fully, the less-than-perfect parts, the parts that they might rather hide. and in turn, opening yourself up to being seen by them. a quote i saw floating around on the internet recently: “love is messy but growth from love is realistic and profound”. &amp;amp; that growth means being honest with yourself about the messy parts, the things you aren’t proud of saying or doing, the moments you wish you could take back. loving people means knowing that they have the capacity to hurt you, just as you have the capacity to hurt them. and the movie says: &lt;em&gt;yes, we’re all flawed, and sometimes we hurt each other. but what if we loved each other through that? what if we stayed, what if we tried? what if we risk the heart?&lt;/em&gt; even if it fails, even if you make the same mistakes, even if you get hurt again. and no matter what, it’s all worth remembering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/eavesdropping&quot;&gt;helena fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt; on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are in the new year, and I want every lesson to be about love. Tell me a story about how the unlikely things work out; tell me about how people stay together when everyone thinks they shouldn’t. Tell me about the bad, rash decisions that last through time, that make it down the years. Tell me that there are rooms where nobody else can go, where best practices and good wisdom cannot reach. Tell me everyone was wrong about keeping your heart safe; tell me that there’s no way to do that anyway. Tell me that what is public is also private, that the known can stay unknown, that something precious can be hoarded away from the light. Tell me that the loud, show-off, screeching things can go home together in the quiet part of the night and close all the windows. Tell me I have more time left, that there is still something beautiful coming, that sometimes delusions work out, and that we can build a life on the thinnest and most selfish feeling, running blue with it down a long day, setting the end of the summer on fire. Tell me a big stupid story about love. Put love up on the projector in the town square so we can all stop our days, walking by on the way to run errands, to stand around and marvel that even now it still happens. Here in the cold at the bottom of the winter, I am looking in every stranger’s window, hoping that they’ll tell me their secrets, and hoping that the secrets are about love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i recently finished zhang yueran’s &lt;em&gt;cocoon&lt;/em&gt;, which was the first time i’ve read a novel by a chinese writer that wasn’t genre fiction. i’m still mulling over my thoughts on it, but it made me think of a fanfiction siyang and i love which is tagged “mommy issues”, “daddy issues”, “issues”. feels appropriate for a novel about intergenerational trauma, buried secrets, loveless marriages and two deeply unhappy children who grow up in the shadow of all of this. it also prompted a conversation with hayley about the chinese fiction that gets preferentially translated into english, and what that says about the west’s voyeuristic preoccupation with certain parts of chinese history. like i said, still chewing on these things, but i’d definitely like to read more chinese novels this year. if anybody has recommendations, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello! i wrote most of this dispatch in a state of delirious exhaustion last weekend, so apologies for how rambling and incoherent it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve been listening to a lot of fall out boy lately, due to my agonies. last week i played &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/6LMC7ZuVNDUQ0tHpGKdd9K?si=nvZyn6TFR7-R_09bd281GA&quot;&gt;folie à deux&lt;/a&gt; all the way through in order for the first time in a while (i almost always listen to albums on shuffle). every time i listen to folie i’m struck again by how lyrically deft it is, how smart and funny and emotionally raw, but playing it in order also made me realise how well-constructed it is, track by track. like, the transition from &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5935qbjUXUmA0I139yFvfB?si=0f546004310e43f8&quot;&gt;disloyal order&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/26VG1uCazw9xtVnq8A1vtd?si=69500565f4504efd&quot;&gt;i don’t care&lt;/a&gt;! they were crazy for that one. the fadeout of &lt;em&gt;nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy&lt;/em&gt; straight into the rolling drums and &lt;em&gt;idgaf!!&lt;/em&gt; energy. the emotional whiplash is insane, and also what being alive is all about. &lt;em&gt;the best of us can find happiness in misery&lt;/em&gt;. exactly! you can sing about being &lt;em&gt;a loose bolt of a complete machine&lt;/em&gt; all you want but the next day you will have to get up. other transitions i love: the three song suckerpunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6MWODwIhaEYqa994aF20My?si=e25013fdd20840fc&quot;&gt;(coffee’s for closers)&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/0h5tb8J4Q9LBbegXrHPvVs?si=0aafbd9a14994893&quot;&gt;what a catch, donnie&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6RyP4ofBSZRQgs8G8y58Kc?si=f4d2c36331d04f5c&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; and of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/63qgyQv5K7EgD4DiwoqeQ0?si=ccc714c353134b26&quot;&gt;20 dollar nose bleed&lt;/a&gt; (my favourite song off this album when i was 16) going into &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5Y5dD1FX0cZzr7sO7giHwD?si=2973e44bf18f428f&quot;&gt;west coast smoker&lt;/a&gt; to round the whole thing off. just perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i love this album for how self-aware it is, how well it understands narcisissm and depression, how sometimes you find yourself almost enjoying the misery because it is a coping mechanism and a way of dealing with [gestures broadly at life]. &lt;em&gt;i’m in love with my own sins / why why why won’t the world revolve around me?&lt;/em&gt; how sometimes being sad makes you self-involved in a way that can actually be bad vibes and unpleasant to be around. but also it’s not your fault. but also, sometimes, it is your fault! these are reflections and thoughts i wouldn’t accept from anyone who doesn’t know intimately what it’s like to be absolutely fucking miserable, btw. pete wentz was in the trenches and he writes about it with such clear eyes and a heart that is always bleeding right open, and that’s what makes these songs so lyrically perfect. it’s an album about wanting to disappear and feeling fucked up and having troubled thoughts but threaded through with a resolute determination, a grit-your-teeth-and-get-the-fuck-up energy. it’s both hopeful and cynical at once. you can lose faith all you want but &lt;em&gt;change will come&lt;/em&gt;. change has to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sarah and i went to see rina sawayama live a couple of weeks ago. i’d been having a bad couple of days; feeling tired, overwhelmed, untethered. but as soon as we got to the venue, the vibe completely shifted. i was standing amongst all these strangers who had come from everywhere to see this artist we all love, excited and happy and feeling good, and i just thought, &lt;em&gt;wow, live music is so great.&lt;/em&gt; i even said this aloud which made me feel approximately 5000 years old. but it is! and the show itself proved the point further. highlights were the emotional catharsis of finally being able to scream along to my top song of 2020 (bad friend—no further questions at this time) and having LUCID on the setlist (if you know you know!!!). &amp;amp; in general she was just so good: incredible stage presence, taking such joy in commanding the crowd, performing her heart out. i am more of a SAWAYAMA fan than her latest album, but hearing the songs live transformed them. they felt alive, and so did i.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a few days afterwards i read an essay by john berger from his final book, &lt;em&gt;confabulations.&lt;/em&gt; i’ve never seen such a good description of the transcendence i always feel when i see music i love performed live; of why songs mean so much to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Songs refer to aftermaths and returns, welcomes and farewells. Or to put it another way: songs are sung to an absence. Absence is what inspired them and it’s what they address. At the same time (and the phrase ‘at the same time’ takes on a special meaning here) in the sharing of the song the absence is also shared and so becomes less acute, less solitary, less silent. And this reduction of the original absence during the sharing of the singing, or even during the memory of such singing, is collectively experienced as something triumphant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We tend to associate intimacy with closeness and closeness with a certain sum of shared experience. Yet every day total strangers, who will never say a single word to one another, can share an intimacy. An intimacy contained in the exchange of a glance, a nod of the head, a smile, a shrug of a shoulder. A closeness which lasts for a second or for the duration of a song being sung and listened to together. An agreement about life. An agreement without clauses. A conclusion spontaneously shared between the untold stories gathered around the song.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also want to share &lt;a href=&quot;https://ramblingsarah.tumblr.com/post/695200380673458176/thetrial-couldnt-stop-thinking-about-this-post&quot;&gt;this recording&lt;/a&gt; of the crowd singing no children by the mountain goats (&amp;amp; associated commentary). i think the beauty of a concert is that it takes something very individual—your own relationship to a song, the feelings you have when you listen to it—and makes it collective. you don’t even have to do anything extra to achieve this sense of collective triumph: it is included in the experience. there’s nothing quite like a shared intimacy you weren’t expecting to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;audrey and i have resumed our marxist reading group of two! this time we’re tackling the grundrisse, which is a collection of seven notebooks drafted by marx but left unpublished in his lifetime. according to marx it is the “first scientific elaboration of communist theory”, which means it sets out the foundations of dialectical materialism, outlines marx’s theory of the value of labour power, the difference between surplus value and profit, and the spheres of capitalist production and circulation. among other things! i actually read roughly 400 pages of this earlier this year, but fell off, and i’m so glad to be reading it again with audrey. discussing marxist theoretical texts brings them alive! it’s always interesting to see which parts of the chapter/text we’ve highlighted as being important or that stood out to us: usually it’s the same, but not always. &amp;amp; of course, often i will arrive having understood very little of the chapter or feeling confused over the key points, and it’s so helpful to have somebody else there (particularly someone as smart, insightful and well-read as audrey) to ask questions of, even ones as broad as: &lt;em&gt;hey i didn’t get this, what do you think it meant&lt;/em&gt;? the moments of clarity that come through trying to explain concepts to each other are honestly the most satisfying thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m also very slowly reading balzac’s &lt;em&gt;cousin bette&lt;/em&gt;. balzac’s comédie humaine, his cycle of novels depicting French society in the mid 1800s, apparently inspired marx (i think? don’t quote me on this). this particular novel is quite hard to read, i can’t lie. it’s supposed to highlight how grasping and depraved bourgeois Parisian society is, and in doing so is actually just quite depressing and full of nasty characters who are horrible to each other and bent on ruining one another for revenge/money/both. &amp;amp; if you’re not horrible then you must be a sanctimonious long-suffering fool. like okay, yeah, fuck the rich! fuck the bourgeoisie! they’re ruining everything! but there is not a single character in this book to root for. i don’t even know whose side balzac is on—definitely not the bourgeoisie (duh), nor the working class (also greedy, ready to become capitalists at any moment) nor the peasants either (savages, coarse-minded). it’s like ursula le guin said, it’s not enough just to orient yourself against everything! there must be something to go towards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m now on season 3 of the sopranos &amp;amp; this show is really carrying me through winter on its back. spoilers for the end of season 2 coming up: the last 3 episodes were some of the best television i’ve ever seen. episode 11 has tony trying to hold down a “legitimate” job at the request of his lawyer and subsequently experiencing panic attacks, mysterious rashes, and being unable to breathe, simply because he has to sit at a desk in an office. he is just like me for real. this is juxtaposed with dr melfi also starting to lose it, because of her moral dilemma over whether it’s “right” to treat tony, plus carmela questioning her marriage and whether she is happy (girl…). then we have episode 12 with probably the most shocking scene so far of this show: janice shooting richie dead. i screamed!!! i did not see it coming at all!!! i knew richie was doomed but i had no idea janice would be the one to off him. what a tense, incredible culmination of both richie’s struggles to assert himself within the mob and janice’s machinations. i hope janice comes back because i found her such a fascinating character; a grifter to her core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then the final episode! tony’s surreal dream sequences while suffering from food poisoning! his subconscious trying to point him to what he has known for a long time: that pussy is a rat. all interspersed with the touches of humour that i love so much about this show: meadow going, &lt;em&gt;don’t be so racist&lt;/em&gt; when carmela says tony ate bad indian food; artie bucco having an extended back-and-forth with tony over whether it was his prawns that caused it. but eventually tony has to drag himself away from the toilet and deal with pussy. that was a hard scene to watch. because the violence of this lifestyle isn’t anonymous, unknown. it’s intimate and familiar. it’s tony, paulie and silvio standing across from pussy, paulie saying, &lt;em&gt;you were like a brother to me,&lt;/em&gt; before the triggers are pulled. it’s these three men having to bag pussy up and toss him into the water, a man they’ve known all their lives. the bodily effort of what they’ve just had to do is visible. it has, and always will be, personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;audrey and i also started young royals season 2, which is just delightful. a treat! the premise is ridiculous but also the exact kind of meal i eat up: wilful “rule-breaker” crown prince of sweden is sent to attend boarding school, realises he is gay, and specifically gay for “socialist simon”……inject it!!! i know that’s right!!! the leads have absolutely off-the-charts chemistry (trust me. every time they look at each other i feel it physically in my chest. when they touched hands in the last episode……). the show is full of teenagers being teenagers, which of course means High Melodrama and wayward behaviour, but i think it’s written sensitively and seems to really care about its characters. i’ll keep you updated!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so true bestie!!! sorry that this segment of the newsletter is just me keeping everyone updated on my watch of the sopranos. but also i’m not sorry at all because it really is that good. moments i’ve loved recently: tony staring down his therapist in silence before attempting to end the session early because he has “nothing to say”; anthony jr discovering existentialism; chris moltisani in his acting for writers class; richie and his insane short man syndrome; paulie attending a seance; the way carmela enunciates &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt;. more generally, something i think that this show is so good at is weaving together multiple character arcs at once and not letting them drop. even when a character spends an episode on the back burner, there’s always still a moment or two where you’re reminded of what’s going on with them. i’m really enjoying both chris and pussy’s storylines this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;loving &lt;em&gt;knives out&lt;/em&gt; is pretty much part of my personality at this point, so i was vibrating with excitement to see the second film, &lt;em&gt;the glass onion&lt;/em&gt;, with hareem, knives out’s other biggest fan. we were terrified it was going to flop, but after seeing all the actors on the red carpet being like, “rian johnson is the mother i never had, the sister i always wanted, the father i deserve, i would do anything to work with him again, and this film SLAPS,” i was pretty confident it would deliver. and it DID. i can’t remember the last time i was so thoroughly and completely entertained by a film. engrossed and enthralled, even! i want my entire life to be narrated by daniel craig in his southern accent. i don’t want to spoil anything for anyone because i think it’s best to go in without any idea of what will happen, but i will say that the glass onion is a fantastic title and also that i think it’s a movie that is very of our present moment in a really specific and fun way. i love films where everybody clearly had a fantastic time making it and are revelling in playing their specific characters. i love how well rian johnson understands what makes a good, clever murder mystery—both the glass onion and knives out could only be made by someone with a deep affection for the genre. i loved this film so much guys. no notes whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently i’ve been thinking about the endings of books. on the rare occasions when i write fiction, i find it almost impossibly difficult to know how or where to end a story. life itself doesn’t have defined beginnings or endings, and yet somehow beginnings feel easier—you have to start somewhere, right? but to end a book or a story, you’re drawing everything to a close. you’re summing up a world the reader has lived in, a journey you’ve taken them on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, then i was thinking about how there are a lot of iconic beginning lines of books: &lt;em&gt;it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man…, call me ishmael, it was the best of times it was the worst of times&lt;/em&gt; etc etc, but how many closing sentences/paragraphs can i recall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the endings that has stayed with me is the final paragraph of annie proulx’s &lt;em&gt;the shipping news:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For […] if a bird with a broken neck could fly away, what else might be possible? Water may be older than light, diamonds crack in hot goat’s blood, mountaintops give off cold fire, forests appear in mid-ocean, it may happen that a crab is caught with the shadow of a hand on its back, that the wind be imprisoned in a bit of knotted string. And it may be that love sometimes occurs without pain or misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as beautiful as this paragraph is on its own, as an ending to the novel specifically, it is perfect. it answers the central question of the book, a question that you didn’t even realise was being asked, right until the moment you read that final line. just so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the left hand of darkness&lt;/em&gt; by ursula le guin ends like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You crossed the Gobrin Ice together,” Sorve demanded, “you and he?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I should like to hear that tale, my Lord Envoy,” said old Esvans, very calm. But the boy, Therem’s son, said stammering, “Will you tell us how he died?—Will you tell us about the other worlds out among the stars—the other kinds of men; the other lives?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what an ending. WHAT an ENDING! again, a perfect summary of the themes and questions the book is considering. of the love that was found during the telling of the story. and of le guin’s own preoccupations throughout her work: how to live, how to look at &lt;em&gt;the other worlds, the other kinds of men, the other lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i of course have to mention hilary mantel. i reread the final pages of a place of greater safety just now as i was writing this and as always, my heart is in my mouth. the final paragraphs return to robespierre, after the deaths of camille and danton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rue Honoré: One day, a long time ago, his mother sat by a window, making lace. The broad morning light streamed in on both of them. He saw that it was the gaps that were important, the spaces between the threads which made the pattern, and not the threads themselves. ‘Show me how to do it, he said. ‘I want to learn.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Boys don’t do it,’ she said. Her face was composed; her work continued. His throat closed at the exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whenever he looks at a piece of lace — even though his eyes are bad — he seems to see every thread in the work. At the Committee table, the image rises at the back of his mind, and forces him to look far, far back into his childhood. He sees the girl on the window-seat, her body swollen, pregnant with death; he sees the light on her bent head; beneath her fingers the airy pattern, going nowhere, flying away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spectacular. it says everything, but in that subtle hilary mantel way where you feel as though you’ve caught the end of a piece of silk and it has run smoothly through your fingers and away. but you had it, just for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think the ending of &lt;em&gt;wolf hall&lt;/em&gt; is brilliant because, during the entire book, wolf hall (the home of the seymour family) scarcely features. it’s only mentioned to allude to some scandalous gossip. and yet it’s the title of the novel! what’s all that about. and then here are the final lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early September. Five days. Wolf Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like i said, i think this is brilliant but i wasn’t sure i quite understood why, so i asked arenike what she thought. she said: “I think it’s interesting in terms of the books being so determined by future events. Like we’re so deeply in the present moment w Cromwell and she captures this feeling of uncertainty and spontaneity but he doesn’t know and we know that everything is leading to that point. The characters at the time are just vibing and she keeps that aliveness and uncertainty going despite the determinism of us knowing the outcome!” this really clarified things for me. when you read those final words, you think &lt;em&gt;of course this is where we ended up.&lt;/em&gt; it gives the ending this feeling of inevitability. and as the reader we then remember that although henry is desperate to marry anne and make her queen, he will eventually move on to jane and the history we are all familiar with marches on. but throughout the book it’s told in such an immediate and urgent way that we almost forget that all of this has already happened. we were always headed to wolf hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;other endings i won’t quote because i don’t have the books to hand or they spoil the events of the book are &lt;em&gt;the round house&lt;/em&gt; by louise erdrich, &lt;em&gt;normal people&lt;/em&gt; by sally rooney (fight me!), &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; by andrew sean greer, &lt;em&gt;gilead&lt;/em&gt; by marilynne robinson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i would like to know what endings of books have stayed with you! please tell me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello, welcome to volume 4! we’re well into october which means i’m entering peak derangement season. buckle up!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/5WrEilrRI5cIW0DxMvQYPZ?si=c73bdb9e25d44629&quot;&gt;jopping&lt;/a&gt; by superm. for non-kpop fans, let me briefly give you some context: imagine you take 7 of the most talented boys from a collection of different boybands to create a supergroup. then you make them sing a song where the lyrics go “when we jumping and it’s popping, we jopping”. yes, it is total nonsense. it’s a completely ludicrous song. and yet (stay with me here) it’s also a masterpiece, purely because these boys are giving it &lt;em&gt;everything.&lt;/em&gt; they are performing their hearts out. they are singing DOWN. they are spitting straight facts. idk, there’s something weirdly comforting about watching people flawlessly execute an incredibly stupid concept. maybe i’m extremely psychologically unwell but also maybe it’s the best song of all time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i continue to be obsessed with the adventures of Tony Soprano and his gaggle of Italian Americans. i finished season 1 with my dad (who has obviously seen the entire show) and am now well into season 2. recently watched an episode where they go to italy and paulie has his Diaspora Kid moment (literally, he meets this woman and is like &lt;em&gt;wow….my grandfather was born in the same town as you…&lt;/em&gt; i yelled. we’ve all been there paulie!!) i think i said this last time but i find the rhythm of this show so soothing. it’s been a while since i watched something so episodic, where every episode has a resolution or a conclusion of some kind. is this just the TV i’ve personally been watching lately or has TV overall changed to this pattern of having long, drawn out arcs and no real distinction between episodes? anyway the writing of this show is so good, so tight and impactful but not in your face about it, and the acting is even better. absolutely loved the plotline in season one involving tony’s mother and uncle jun, culminating in this bonkers scene where [spoilers] tony finds out from the FBI that his mother was plotting to kill him and his therapist is like &lt;em&gt;i told you you had mommy issues.&lt;/em&gt; SCREAMING. livia soprano you will not see heaven!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;elete and i finally finished watching &lt;em&gt;succession&lt;/em&gt; season 3! yes, we’re about a year late but both of us are loyal bitches and when we promised to watch the rest of the season together we stuck to it. actually, now i think about it, succession is a recent show that is quite episodic. particularly this season, where it felt like SO MUCH happened in each episode. when we were watching the finale i suddenly remembered the season 2 finale and how excited i was for kendall, only to watch him completely crash and burn this season. his arc really is tragic in the classic sense (sorry!!! it’s true!!!) like you know he’s doomed and of course there would be no out for him, and yet you’re hoping for it anyway. and it’s that hope that really guts you. that final episode, where he’s sat on the floor completely breaking down……whew!!! jeremy strong you delivered king!!! i have to say i wasn’t expecting the siblings to make a united stand, but i loved it. of course, at the end of it all, it’s kendall sat in the dust and the only people around him are shiv and roman. of course. how could it be any other way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also watched &lt;em&gt;turning red&lt;/em&gt; with sarah on the weekend. so many people have told me: &lt;em&gt;you, SPECIFICALLY, need to watch this film,&lt;/em&gt; which meant i knew it had to be about hyperfixation, and it was! it so perfectly captures what it’s like to be intensely obsessed with a boyband. the girls who get it? they truly, truly get it. the amount of times one of the characters would say something unhinged and deranged about their boys and i would just quietly go, “me”. yes, this movie is about and for 13 year olds!!! but some of us are still in the trenches fighting for our lives!!! i felt like the storyline involving the main character meilin and her mother was a bit too simplistic and easily wrapped up for my tastes but i guess it is ultimately for adolescent/teen girls who probably don’t need to be told “sometimes it just is what it is and what it is can often be intensely and deeply complicated with no real resolution”.  anyway !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i just started a new novel by a young author about being a queer young millennial attempting to live and love. honestly, i don’t know why i haven’t learned my lesson with these books yet. i keep picking them up in the hopes that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; book will finally be the one to move me, make me think about the meaning of relation, make me love the characters, even though i know i’m going to end up disappointed and pissed off. and once again, i am disappointed and pissed off! why are all these books that purport to be about “flawed people learning to love each other” actually about people who are incredibly cruel to each other and who are totally uninvested in trying to be a good or kind person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’m sick of reading about people who i would hate in real life. like, i’m only 50 pages into this book and the main character has already been fatphobic multiple times, anti-black towards a woman who was interested in her romantically, said that butch lesbians are “as bad as any men”, and also transphobic. ??? why am i reading this??? it feels like the author has decided that the only way for a person to be flawed is for them to actively hold and espouse terrible political opinions, which is an idea i rebel against wholly and fully. to be flawed, to fuck up, to fail is so human. but it doesn’t have to equal holding structurally harmful views. not to be on my fanfiction agenda at all times but i could open up archiveofourown dot org and find over one hundred stories that are about people who mess up, hurt each other &amp;amp; miscommunicate and yet who aren’t total arseholes and, importantly, are treated with care by the narrative. by which i mean they are given the opportunity to grow, change and learn from their mistakes. they are flawed, yes, but they are also written as people who are trying to be good, trying to do better by the people they love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another example of this is &lt;em&gt;sorrow and bliss&lt;/em&gt; by meg mason, a truly incredible novel about how to live and love, to forgive and be forgiven. it’s not overly sentimental, not cloying or twee: real hurt is done by people to each other, and they have to search for how to move forwards. more than any other novel i’ve read, it shows how it takes work to be in relation to one other. it feels real, unlike any of these other millennial novels about flawed people and difficult friendships. when reading these books i’m continually &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; that people understand one another, that they love and care about their friends despite being horrible to each another,  and sorry but i simply don’t believe it! i want to read books with a heart, with characters that fuck up and fail but who care about the people and the world around them, who change and are changed by each other. is that too much to ask for? i don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a total 180 from that book, i am also reading john reed’s &lt;em&gt;ten days that shook the world,&lt;/em&gt; an incredible history of the october revolution. specifically, it’s a meticulous account of the events just preceding and following the seizure of state power by the bolsheviks. i think what this close focus accomplishes is a real emphasis on how chaotic and tumultuous those days were and how difficult it was for them to maintain control of the revolution. at the time, nobody thought the bolsheviks would last longer than 3 days in power, and reading this book you can see why: the forces stacked against them were so powerful. only with rigorous discipline and the might and dedication of the industrial proletariat could they fight back against the almost-instantaneous counter-revolution, make an alliance with the peasantry, navigate through the strikes of every government ministry and consolidate power. it really brings home what an achievement the revolution was—not only the victory in the class struggle but everything that came afterwards. it’s honestly mind-blowing when you think about it. as everyone reading this will know, i think lenin was that bitch but please allow me to reiterate: he really was that bitch!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello! volume 3 turned out way more earnest than the other two. sorry about that. blame it on the seasons changing and the fact that i’ve been listening to angel of realtime by gang of youths for 3 days straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have nothing to write here because, in a very uncharacteristic move, i haven’t watched a single episode of TV since i last wrote this newsletter, unless you count ATEEZ’s reality shows where they do missions inside a “haunted” house and reenact famous k-dramas. i won’t subject you to my reflections on those but please rest assured that i have never had a normal thought about this boyband in my life and i don’t intend to start now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while sarah and i were in florence, we saw some of michelangelo’s works: david, and the tombs of the medici. i’ve seen them before, but i felt overwhelmed all over again standing there in front of them. there’s something just so special about seeing those sculptures in real life—the physicality of them, the way they take up space in a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when you approach david, you go past some of michelangelo’s unfinished works. i love those sculptures so much. even unfinished, they manage to be dynamic, alive: they look as though they’re clawing themselves out of stone, prising the marble away, bringing themselves into being. when you get close, you can see the chisel marks on the stone. it’s a reminder that these statues are made out of hard rock, as soft and malleable as they might look in their finished form, and of the work and craft and effort that it took to chip away at something so hard and unyielding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sarah described michelangelo as having “a reverence for the body”, which i think is a perfect descriptor. it’s the attention to detail that really gets me, the depth of understanding of how bodies look and move and are held together. the way the muscles in your back move when you look over your shoulder. the folds in your stomach when you lie down. the vein running down your hand. the tendon behind your knee. your ankle bone. michelangelo saw it all, every detail, and he cared enough to learn how to carve it all out of stone and immortalise it in the most beautiful sculptures ever made. there they are. and here we are, looking at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about six different people messaged me after the news about hilary mantel passing away, probably a testament to how often i manage to corner someone to scream “SHE’S THE GREATEST LIVING WRITER” at them. everything i want to say about hilary mantel feels like hyperbole: she was a genius, her books are masterpieces that will live on forever, etc etc etc. but i mean it all. there will never be another writer like her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;many of the books i read are forgettable. sometimes i feel completely untouched by them, like my eyes are just gliding across the pages, untethered. hilary mantel’s books reach out and grab you by the neck. they are solid, weighty things. reading them is to be held inside history for a brief period of time; a total immersion. every time i emerge breathless and gasping. even when i know what’s coming, even when the history is deeply familiar to me, even when i’m reading the book for the fifth time: somehow she always manages to surprise me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the historical figures she writes about are mercurial, slippery; somehow she gets inside their heads and makes us understand their motivations, their flaws, what prompts them to action. she could write about huge historical events with the depth and magnitude they deserve, but also zero in on the small, human details like the touch of a palm in yours, or the way the sun looks rising over the thames. she understood how we are all haunted by our past and the people we have loved. and she was funny! she was so funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i thought about trying to find some of my favourite parts of her books to share here, but i honestly think she’s not a writer who can be easily excerpted. i’ll leave you with this, though; a better character study in a paragraph than some authors manage in an entire book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hello and welcome back to the latest edition of things i am rotating inside my mind like the world’s most deranged microwave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the king by ATEEZ. &lt;em&gt;the king is dead! [sirens blaring] let’s get up! let’s go up!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last seen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i know nobody cares beyond me about the heading change, but my reasoning is that i think &lt;em&gt;last seen&lt;/em&gt; is better because it can encompass art &amp;amp; live music as well as tv/movies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;last week i visited the barbara hepworth museum with claire, which is her studio and garden in st ives. i loved it so much. i’ve always felt drawn to her sculptures when i’ve seen them before in galleries, but the sensation of being in the garden, being able to move around and through the sculptures, was so different. it felt so right to see them in a natural environment, amongst the foliage, in the rain and sun. i liked that we were by the sea; it’s clear to see the influence of the landscape and the way the sea weathers and erodes rock on the pieces. it was special to see her studio, too, and the unfinished sculptures in the process of becoming. art can be beautiful because it seems effortless but it’s grounding to realise how much work goes into creating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Above all there was the sensation of moving physically over the contours of fulnesses and concavities, through hollows and over peaks—feeling, touching, seeing, through mind and hand and eye…I am the form and I am the hollow, the thrust and the contour.”  — Barbara Hepworth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;currently watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kinnporsche. okay so i’m now on episode 8 and i honestly cannot believe that people think it’s good. it is like watching a badly written mafia au fanfiction with zero relationship development—well, actually reading a fanfiction would probably be more enjoyable than watching kinnporsche because at least i’d go into the fanfiction with a baseline investment in the characters. whereas my feelings towards kinn (the mafia boss) lie somewhere on a scale that ranges from complete apathy to active dislike. in the last episode i watched he casually tells porsche (bodyguard who he recently started dating) that he murdered his ex-boyfriend because he thought his ex was spying on him. this is presented as a sad, tender moment of confession, not because kinn regrets killing someone but because the experience has left him with “trust issues”. sir, what? no actually, WHAT? YOU have trust issues??? like, i’m supposed to care about this guy? don’t get me wrong, i do enjoy morally complex characters (jiang cheng &amp;amp; jaime lannister as prime examples). but i need to understand their motivations, see them struggle with their choices, and also undergo some form of character development. with kinn? there’s nothing! porsche is also disappointingly 2D—i had hopes for him after seeing him struggling with how his role as a bodyguard means he has to hurt and kill people who are like his parents/people he knows, but then that went absolutely nowhere! god i really need to stop watching this but it’s like a car crash i can’t look away!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the sopranos. oh it was alllllll over for me as soon as i realised tony has mommy issues a mile wide. before going in, abeera told me that this show is the most accurate representation of therapy she’s seen on tv and she was completely correct. i’m midway through season 1 and can’t wait to continue. the rhythm and pace of tv has changed so much over the years so there’s something very comforting about returning to an old classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the bear. two weeks later and i’m still on the same episode i was last time. i know I KNOW. i’m keeping it on the list so i actually don’t abandon it because i do want to finish! i love complicated sibling feelings! i love found family! i love cooking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;drive to survive. you know when you watch something and you’re like, well unfortunately this is going to change me as a person? i fear that watching daniel riccardio win the 2018 monaco grand prix did exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;right now i’m in the middle of &lt;em&gt;the idiot&lt;/em&gt; by dostoyevsky. it’s been a while since i’ve read a Big Classic Novel, and i’ve really missed the feeling of settling into one. often reading long classics feels a bit like watching a soap opera or reading fanfiction—hear me out!! they’ve got characters with big personalities, events happening all the time, improbable plot twists, heightened emotions, long exchanges of dialogue, exposition… anyway i am enjoying the experience. i can’t say i’m always 100% clear on what is happening (had to resort to sparknotes because i completely missed the point of a couple of chapters) but i love how melodramatic everything is, how intensified all the feelings are, how a character will undergo a personality change in like 2 paragraphs, how you can never be sure exactly what someone’s motivations are or whether they even know themselves. it’s messy and chaotic and i love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hi! welcome to the first edition of whatever this substack is. i thrive off of rigidly-planned structure, so i’m going to organise it into four sections: listening / watching / reading / other. these might stay the same every time or maybe they’ll shift, who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;on repeat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/2PmLP4DNUPJC98L78mrkal?si=f18d4e964064474e&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; by lee mujin, which i have listened to it at least ten times per day since i first discovered it. look, hear me out: imagine if jason mraz a) could actually sing and b) made a perfect song. i’m obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4IzGCCxBtppHFNeSplnWLT?si=01546a4e18fd46e6&quot;&gt;guilty pleasure&lt;/a&gt; by key, delivering yet another win for the gay kpop stan community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HcVZm_4qAI&amp;amp;ab_channel=KQENTERTAINMENT&quot;&gt;guerrilla&lt;/a&gt; by ATEEZ, which i still can’t believe actually exists and isn’t something sarah and i dreamed up in a state of fevered hysteria. honestly please just listen to their entire revolutionary uprising concept &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3fgDrbflffzvV3H3plG9e6?si=Ec_byEFfROSwST50T8NU4g&quot;&gt;album&lt;/a&gt;. you’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6MWODwIhaEYqa994aF20My?si=f8c5eeca1588455f&quot;&gt;(coffee’s for closers)&lt;/a&gt; by fall out boy. listen, i am who i am and i’ll never stop feeling insane about the juxtaposition of the lyrics ‘i will never believe in anything again / oh change will come’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;last watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the last movie i watched was &lt;em&gt;shoplifters&lt;/em&gt; which sarah has been telling me i should watch for probably years at this point, but i have been resisting because i find it hard to sit down and watch movies which i know are going to devastate me. it very much did devastate me, but i also loved it. the director said the key question on his mind while making it was, “what makes a family?” i would add to this: how can we make a family when our means and ability to do that are so constricted by having to earn money to live? what are the limitations of the care we can give to each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it reminded me of other films about alternative families i’ve seen—&lt;em&gt;dear tenant&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;take me home&lt;/em&gt;. both of those are also about the state intervening in a family unit they consider unfit to take care of children. but i feel like where they differed from shoplifters is that those films are a critique of how homophobia prevents gay people from being caretakers of children and therefore the caretakers themselves are legitimised in the narrative (they have jobs, they’re respectable, they are good for the kids, the children are upset and traumatised by being removed from them). shoplifters is more subtle in that it shows that even the families you choose have their limitations and difficulties. at the end of the film, the “mother” of the family says to the “father”: &lt;em&gt;we’re not good enough for shota&lt;/em&gt;, who is one of the children they’ve been looking after. shota’s own feelings on the matter are left up to the viewer to decide. it feels like the film is asking: is not good enough better than nothing? and is it better to try and fail to take care of each other than not to try at all? if all you can teach children is how to shoplift, isn’t that something? is it even possible to have “good enough”, in this world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;current watches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the bear. it’s actually ridiculous that i haven’t finished this show because the episodes are so short but i just never know if i’m in the mood for it because i never know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kinnporsche, a gay thai drama where a mafia boss falls for his bodyguard (i know. elete once asked me, “where do you &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; these shows?” and the answer is, unfortunately, being a dumb bitch with terrible taste who is terminally online.) everyone on the internet is going insane over kinnporsche so i was like okay let’s check it out and see what the fuss is all about! anyway i’m on episode seven and i think my overriding feeling is that i am being emotionally manipulated into caring about this relationship. maybe this is my cross to bear after spending my formative years cataloguing every tiny wisp of homoeroticism in [insert tv show here], but i hate being TOLD by a show that two characters are into each other. i would like to see it develop with my own two eyes thanks! anyway i will continue to watch because my critique needs to be fully informed by the narrative, but i fear that the girls might be wrong about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;drive to survive. one thing about me is that i LOVE a sports documentary. the stakes: high. the drama: endless. engines: revving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;reads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after reading &lt;em&gt;tropic of orange&lt;/em&gt; i wanted to read more of karen tei yamashita’s work; after reading &lt;em&gt;i hotel&lt;/em&gt; i was like well now i need to read everything she’s ever published. currently i’m reading &lt;em&gt;brazil-maru&lt;/em&gt;. i think yamashita does social novels so well. i don’t quite know how to put this but she understands what makes things happen for people, and is so adept at describing the way events sequence up to form a life, lives, history. the glaring thing about this book, though, is that it’s about japanese immigrants colonising brazil in the 30s and so far it’s missing a critique of the settler-colonial mindset of “this is new land! we are bringing civilisation to the forest!” even when one of the colonists “discovers” an “ancient indian burial mound”, it’s presented completely uncritically. i’m disappointed because i thought yamashita had better politics than this, but i will reserve final judgement until after i’ve read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also just finished reading a collection of essays about imperialism called &lt;em&gt;the veins of the south are still open&lt;/em&gt;. i particularly liked john smith’s essay about super-exploitation, and the patnaiks’ first essay on the value of money &amp;amp; imperialism: both left me wanting to read more on their theories and conclusions. i found this a useful revisitation of marx’s concepts of surplus-value, competition &amp;amp; monopoly, and the limits of marx’s capital in explaining the political economy of today. note that this doesn’t mean a repudiation of marxism, more an extension of it—marx was writing before imperialism had become fully developed as a global system and therefore the task of theorists today is to use marxist methods to extend the ideas of capital into an analysis of the world’s current economic system. i found some of the essays less strong—there was one that outright stated a disagreement with john smith’s conclusions but i was left confused both as to what that disagreement was &amp;amp; crucially whether i agreed with it or not? i also feel like sometimes with marxists, i need to know whether their disagreements are actually diametrically opposed to one another (e.g. john smith and david harvey, who he absolutely bodies) or if they’re oriented in broadly the same direction but are differing on small points of interpretation. more reading, as always, to be done!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the cucumber plants on our balcony that are still diligently producing fruit. the “kpop punk” playlist i have been meticulously curating with assistance from alfie, which is a list of kpop songs paired with thematically/lyrically similar pop punk songs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://billmoyers.com/story/poetry-month-what-resembles-the-grave-but-isnt/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by anne boyer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikkoharvey/status/1562776283855011841&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; poem by dean young. the moment of the day when It’s Time To BeReal. homemade granola. a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ch4YZTJgxhY/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D&quot;&gt;reel&lt;/a&gt; of yunho and mingi dancing to replay. a woman telling me that i could do a V5 route at the bouldering centre and then yelling, “don’t think, don’t think!” as i scrambled my way up there. &amp;amp; finally: &lt;a href=&quot;https://reformedgirlprince.tumblr.com/post/693950666407870464&quot;&gt;if you know you know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that’s all for this time. see you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
