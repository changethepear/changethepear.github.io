(and also, needless to say, its tolerance for sexual abusers.) </p><p>anyway, shortly after this news broke i was lying on the sofa with cramps and feeling sorry for myself, and i decided i wanted to rewatch <em>the last dance</em>, the netflix documentary that chronicles michael jordan and the bulls’ record-breaking, belief-defying six championship wins. i love this documentary. when abeera and i first watched it, we watched about 3 episodes at a time, because i was so gripped by it. it’s the sheer joyful disbelief of just how good michael jordan is; it’s how every single person interviewed still <em>feels</em> every emotion they had at the time, years later; it’s MJ being the king of petty (“and i took that personally”); it’s the inevitable arc towards glory and the unpredictable nature of sport; it’s about the players’ love for the game and for each other; it’s about an entire city transformed (“mom and dad said we could either have presents under the tree or go to see a bulls game”). the documentary is about michael jordan and his greatness, true, but it also takes time to highlight that he couldn’t do it alone. he needed scottie pippen and dennis rodman; he needed a team of people who wanted so badly to live up to his expectations that they worked their asses off; he needed phil jackson and his triangle offence. it’s not quite “there’s no i in team” because there is the best basketball player who ever lived and it’s michael jordan (the moment where he switches direction and just hangs in the air, three seconds on the clock, and sinks the shot…. i paused it and made hana sit down to watch with me). but it quietly affirms that being the GOAT can only take you so far. to do what he did with the bulls—win and win again, and win one more time, and then do it twice over—the whole team needs to pull their weight. and they do, and it’s magical.  could something like that ever happen again? the hope feels ever slimmer as sports teams increasingly turn into corporations fueled by capitalist greed. but there’s always hope. </p><div><hr></div><h4>last seen</h4><ul><li><p>the last forty minutes of the return of the king, on their first night, claire so tired they were like, “is this what dying feels like?” while hana and i cried our eyes out at frodo and sam’s final steps up mount doom, the fellowship’s final desperate stand, the final goodbye and journey into the west on the final ship. entering for the very last moments really hammered home how frodo’s task takes everything he has, every last shred of courage and willpower while being torn apart by forces nobody else could understand. a masterpiece!!!!!</p></li><li><p>die hard. what is there to say? this is a perfect movie. so funny, so well-paced, alan rickman is impeccable, so many unbelievably good one-liners. yippee kai yay motherfucker!</p></li><li><p>the bourne identity. not as perfect as die hard, mainly because it is too concerned with interiority rather than bruce willis quipping like his life depends on it. it wants to both be an action movie and deconstruct action movie heroes and therefore it can never quite succeed at either.</p></li><li><p>in and out. new to me and i had the best time. i love being gay. i love gay people. macho man scene gets 10/10 as does the scene where kevin cline’s student is like “of course people think you’re gay, you BIKE to school”, because i had said the same thing about five minutes before. it’s okay to stereotype when it’s funny! </p></li><li><p>the polka king. FIVE STARS… jan lewan the polka king, claire’s mum’s irl friend, has a wild life story and jack black puts his entire pussy into playing it onscreen. you have to see it to believe it. there’s such warmth, humour and heart to this movie. now i’m rapping polka ! </p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h4>reading</h4><p>imagine you’re six years old and you’re the bastard son of the king-in-waiting except when your existence is revealed he abdicates the throne (and later dies so you actually never saw him at all) and then you’re taken to the court to grow up but nobody really takes an interest in you except your father’s old right hand man who happens to be the stablemaster (dad stand-in number 1) except one day the king notices you and decides to turn you into a weapon so you then start getting assassin training in secret from the king’s bastard brother (dad stand-in number 2) but nobody can know about it and then you start seeing the king’s fool around and he sometimes says weird riddles or sings a love song to you and so you’re kind of friends but you also don’t know if he’s mocking you so honestly you don’t really think about it much and then your youngest uncle tries to murder you like three times and also frame you for murder when you’re on a diplomatic mission to try and find your other uncle (now the king in waiting, but most importantly dad stand-in number 3) a wife but you somehow survive and secure the diplomatic marriage but now youngest uncle is out baying for your blood. oh and in the midst of all this you realise you also have a type of despised magic that means you can bond with animals and nobody knows except the stablemaster who also despises you for using it. </p><p>anyway then you’re back at court and you secretly bond with a wolf but honestly that’s the least of your problems because the king is dying and your assassin mentor (also the king’s bastard brother, see above) keeps being really weird about it and also your kingdom is at war with these red ship raiders and you have to go and fight off enemies with your axe and then your uncle who’s the king-in-waiting goes off on a quest to reawaken these ancient beings called the elderlings and meanwhile your youngest uncle is draining funds and partying and calling himself king-in-waiting while also slowly draining the life force from the actual king and trying to kill you and your absent uncle’s wife and her unborn child so you and dad stand-in number 2 hatch a plan to spirit her off to the mountains with the king’s fool except everything goes wrong and you get betrayed and end up framed for the king’s murder and youngest uncle arrests you and beats you and tortures you to death but you survive because you manage to soulbond into your wolf’s body and then dad stand-ins number 1 and 2 dig up your corpse and call you back into your old body. and nobody else knows you’re alive not even your girlfriend who is carrying your child but you don’t even know that because you’re kind of hopeless on picking up signs so you basically give up on things and drive away your dads and live as a man-wolf for a bit but then decide you want revenge on youngest uncle so you try to kill him but fail miserably and while you’re doing that dad stand-in 3 tells you through a command in your brain using the ancient magic of the royal bloodline (that you never quite mastered because the guy teaching it to you tried to kill you and yes you do carry an unreasonable amount of shame and self-punishment around this matter) to come find him in the mountains and assist him and you take your wolf and travel all the way there and meet some characters along the way including like 4 women who want to sleep with you because you’re really sexy even though you have no self-esteem but you’re also being pursued and hunted by youngest uncle whose underlings capture you but you escape and then get shot in the back by an arrow and you walk in agonising pain to collapse at the feet of someone who turns out to be the king’s fool and he thought you were dead this whole time and he tells you you’re beautiful twice and that he missed you and presses his brow to yours and says “if there is another my fate is twined around, i am glad it is you” and also tells you that you are destined to save the world together which he already kind of told you and you didn’t believe him but now that shit is getting kind of real. </p><p>and then you somehow recover from this arrow wound that probably should have killed you and you go on a quest with the fool and your uncle’s wife to find your uncle (the good one) while being pursued by your uncle (the bad one) and eventually you find good uncle carving a dragon out of stone and to make the dragon you need to dip your hands in liquid magic and put all of your memories and sense of self into it and he’s been doing that alone but when you get there he manages to get help from one of your party so he can complete the dragon but before he disappears into the dragon bodyswaps with you so he can have sex with his wife one last time to produce an heir. oh also btw remember dad stand-in number 1? he’s now in love with the woman who you thought was the love of your life and also has had your bastard child so you end up putting some of your own pain into a dragon and while all of this is going on it seems like the fool is making more and more predictions that turn out to be true so maybe his whole thing about being a prophet is real and then good uncle puts himself into the dragon and then it turns out that you can awaken more stone dragons using your animal bonding power and they all fly away to defeat the red ships and save the kingdom and you decide to stay behind and before the fool leaves he kisses you on the mouth. </p><p>all this AND MORE happened to my good friend fitzchivalry farseer. read assassin’s apprentice, royal assassin and assassin’s quest if you want to suffer like me! \n</p><figure>\n<img

OKAY???? in fact many of the songs mark has written (solo and for take that) are about a mysterious someone who he adores and idolises and misses. much to think about.</p>\n<p>mark had his heart broken when robbie left take that (source: gary barlow) and recent investigation of the archives has uncovered several quotes from both of them which have been very damaging to my psyche, including mark saying that having robbie beside him makes him feel complete and that “rob still… has always been in take that”, and robbie saying that “when i think about mark i cry”. pain misery suffering etc. robbie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqB_As99j4Q&amp;ab_channel=nuttys66\">brought mark on stage in 2003 to sing back for good</a>, which is a very crazy song to choose to perform with your former bandmate while he snuggles into your side adoringly. in MY opinion!!!!! <em>no more fighting…..and forever we will be….. so complete in our love…..</em> anyway thank god there is a happy ending to all this torment. we’ve all seen the take that reunion on x factor, i’m sure, but in case you’ve forgotten: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPXASNCZrio&amp;ab_channel=JoinTheBizzo\">here it is</a>. (hana [through tears]: that was real…. that was REAL. iman: nothing can ever replicate the intensity of that night of their reunion btw. mark and robbie…..)</p>\n<p>mark and robbie indeed. gary barlow and robbie williams are a whole other story, from initial antipathy/personality clash as teenagers to full-blown hatred throughout their twenties to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv49bC5xGVY\">music video</a> where they take their shirts off while gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes and prepare to jump off a cliff together. nothing has ever gagged me as severely as seeing this music video for the first time btw. i could not believe my eyes.</p>\n<p>being serious, i think the robbie/gary relationship is actually very moving and poignant. to be thrust into fame, particularly of the boyband variety, at such a young age is bound to wreak absolute havoc not only on you, but on your relationships as well. the thing about boybands is that their success is often made by these deep, profound connections between their members. and the other thing is that they’re just as often broken by the ruptures of said connections. they provide both the ingredients for these relationships and also for their destruction, because while your closeness with the other members is encouraged and facilitated both by the fans and the management and the desperate need for connection and closeness with the only other people who understand your specific situation, the pressure cooker environment you’re in will inevitably deepen and intensify any existing cracks. robbie’s departure from the band was something he blamed gary for, and he exercised his hurt in very public displays of cruelty towards gary (and the band in general), refusing to rejoin the band when they reunited in 2005. but eventually reconciliation did happen, robbie recorded a whole new album with take that and they performed their iconic song <em>the flood</em> live on x factor in 2010. what a time to be alive.</p>\n<p>robbie has spoken very candidly on many occasions about his mental health and struggles with addiction. i was particularly moved by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DCd76Fpu_FE\">this letter</a> he recently wrote to their old manager; his honesty in reflecting on how being part of take that hastened those struggles and was a very difficult and horrible time for him at a very young age—but also he doesn’t hide behind being unwell, or young, as an excuse for his treatment of gary and the hurt that he’s inflicted. i think it’s remarkable to come to such self-awareness about your mistakes, to have humility enough to embark on a bridge-building process with the person and people you’ve mistreated, and also an understanding that forgiveness does not totally remove the pain.</p>\n<p>also (last thing i promise) whatever else we may feel about gary barlow, i have to hand it to him: he can write a song. <a href=\"https://genius.com/Take-that-back-for-good-lyrics\">in the twist of separation, you excelled at being free</a>? sir?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>currently watching</h2>\n<p>the traitors. obviously it’s the traitors. i’m typing this ahead of episode 10, so who knows what is in store during the final 3 episodes, but i am PRAYING for minah to somehow come out on top. she can’t be that taken in by charlotte, right? the welsh accent isn’t really doing the trick of making charlotte seem trustworthy. right???</p>\n<p>i love this show. i love how stupid the british public are, i love when random beef starts for no reason, i love when people get bitchy and self-righteous, and i love when the entire round table turns on someone because they say one thing that is immediately deemed <em>one hundred percent traitor behaviour</em>. i said to hana and matthew that i really would love to see a traitors series full of the It’s A Game type (dan, alexander, etc) to see how these pure strategists try to outmanoeuvre each other. obviously this would run alongside another series with people who start beefing 20-year-old boys for saying they’re in a clique and people who get pissed off because they get out of a rowing boat of their own accord and nobody else does.</p>\n<p>my worst enemy of this season is obviously joe, who is a clown and a fool and pissing me off every time he opens his stupid mouth to ask people why they didn’t vote for him to get a shield because he’s clearly the most trustworthy person, or to be rude to someone for no reason whatsoever (because they’re a doctor? because they were tired after doing all the work in the challenge that you were too weak to do?) or to say it’s absolutely definitively someone only to be proved absolutely wrong five seconds later. I HATE HIM!!!! my other worst enemies were livi and every single person who started saying “but why am i still here?” um… maybe because the traitors can only kill one person each night and they’re being strategic! for god’s sake! i think you people are thinking about yourselves way too much or whatever jemima kirke said!</p>\n<p>edit after episode 10 to add: the euphoria of finally booting joe off absolutely dampened by minah’s exit. feel like pure shit just want her back</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>reading</h2>\n<p>i had a whole tirade ready for launch in this substack about a certain fantasy series i’ve been reading lately, when shireen informed me that most people’s deep love for the books probably stems from reading it when they were adolescents. at which point i had to take a step back and say, <em>am i really going to go on a rant about a book which is, technically, for children?</em> while it is my belief that the best and most worthwhile children’s literature should hold up to adult scrutiny, when i lent ames my copy of <em>princess academy</em> (a teen favourite that i still have deep affection for now) and they were like, “miriam… it’s not good”, i knew they were probably right but it was still hard to hold space for. and so, out of respect, i am going to choose the path of peace. but if you’re interested, the tirade does exist and i am willing to share it.</p>\n<p>otherwise, it’s been a pretty good month for books! i can’t pick one in particular to talk about, so i’ll do summaries of everything i’ve read so far in january:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>blood sweat glitter</em> by iona datt sharma. short and sweet! the enemies-to-lovers romance wasn’t developed super well, but i really enjoyed the depiction of trying to find purpose and community in london in your mid-to-late twenties. haha lol !</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>trash</em> by sylvia aguilar-zéleny. loved this short novella, centred around the municipal garbage dump in ciudad juárez, mexico. incredible voice in this one and the characters were so vividly depicted. i wish it had been longer!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>solar storms</em> by linda hogan. i had never heard of linda hogan before reading about her on kat’s <a href=\"https://earswithknife.substack.com/p/backlist\">list</a> of 2024 book reviews, but i am so glad i found this book. i wrote a longer review for my bookstagram, which i will be posting once the book (from the us, via claire in london) arrives with me in february, so look out for that! i’m not sure i’ll read a more evocative book this year. so deeply felt and full of grace. read if you like louise erdrich, lakes, forgiveness, quiet places and the complexities of organising.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>big swiss</em> by jen beagin. hysterically funny. the first book in a long time to make me actually laugh out loud. the emotional core didn’t hit as hard as i think the author perhaps intended it to, because i was essentially reading it as a satire of how tapped americans in upstate new york can be. the therapy sessions the main character is transcribing, by a bookie therapist who has taken Om as his name, truly had me howling. read if you liked <em>all fours</em> by miranda july but wished that everyone in the book was just that little bit extra batshit insane.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>years and years</em> by hwang jungeun. love love loved this book. really thoughtful depiction of the lives of three korean women (one mother, two daughters). unexpectedly moving and has a quiet fierceness to it. really great example of how to write political fiction, by simply depicting characters whose lives are politicised; politics is happening <em>to</em> them, not around them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>madonna in a fur coat</em> by sabahattin ali. that’s the last time i take a book rec from twitter. i was moved by parts of this short novel but essentially it is 1920s turkish john green.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>fight night</em> by miriam toews. amusing and poignant family saga, but i was left wondering about the 9-year-old narrator, swiv, and her wellbeing. she is dealing with a lot of family trauma and has far too much responsibility on her shoulders for her years, and i didn’t feel like the narrative really dealt with it properly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>vanity fair</em> by william makepeace thackeray. i love you becky sharp… read if you like dickens but you wish he was less sentimental and more focused on cracking the whip of satire at regency society.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>miscellaneous</h2>\n<p>my grandma greeting us with “where’s my lovely hana?” the sound of the trees in the wind in kalamunda. big tapestries at the cultural centre. a sunset walk with hana down whistlepipe gully. the kookaburras laughing. hana dancing with lucia. making a big fish with erin on christmas day. my grandma’s delight at a <a href=\"https://www.ianlawson.com/books/from-the-land/\">big photography book</a> from the outer hebrides. enzo holding the lead in his mouth when we walked him. walking over the craggy limestone of the henderson cliffs and seeing a white-bellied sea eagle. birdwatching with matthew and romesh. grilled squid and a scallop on the side. listening to angels five times in a row in the car. spotting an eastern blue tongue lizard on my way home. watching canberra united WIN!! hanging out with sophie, cathy, ash and morgan. elete selecting new photos for a photo frame she got me. the matching necklaces that rachel made for us. buying shorts from the boys’ section. wandering around the botanic gardens with bee (sunshine personified!!) and talking for hours. bright bougainvillea against deep blue skies. <a href=\"https://soracities.tumblr.com/post/689039127192158208/a-week-after-svens-funeral-im-cooking-fish\">this</a> compilation of excerpts. <a href=\"https://seemoreandmore.tumblr.com/post/708086220683657216/life-while-you-wait-performance-without\">this</a> poem by wisława szymborska. calls with friends, which always, but especially so these days, feel like lifelines.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>take care of yourselves out there. see you soon.</p>\n",
