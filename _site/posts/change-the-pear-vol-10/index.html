<p>hello! i‚Äôm back. someone (elete or hayley maybe?) once said that the year doesn‚Äôt start until lunar new year has passed, so here‚Äôs the first newsletter of the real new year. happy year of the rabbit! it‚Äôs a year of escaping demons, of running fast and free, of <a href="https://kairisk.tumblr.com/post/707195561572499456/if-they-catch-you-they-will-kill-you-but-first">being swift and full of tricks</a>, of becoming ungovernable. let‚Äôs get it.</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0Rw35DKIumkbbMC7XPOn5r?si=ef345488cbef4b71">heartbreak feels so good</a> by fall out boy. is there any better feeling than your favourite band releasing music that reminds you exactly why you love them? i listened to this song once, immediately texted alfie, ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs for us‚Äù, and proceeded to listen to it nonstop for the next 2 hours. <em>we could cry a little / cry a lot / don‚Äôt stop dancing don‚Äôt dare stop / we‚Äôll cry later or cry now</em>‚Äîlouder!!! i know pete wentz didn‚Äôt actually write these lyrics for my own personal catharsis‚Ä¶but it <em>feels</em> like he did. anyway, patrick described the upcoming fob album as ‚Äúfrom under the cork tree part 4‚Äù, and i cannot wait to listen to it. in the same interview, he says <em>i sit around and try and help other people tell their stories. and it‚Äôs always a joy when i get to help pete tell his.</em> like if you cried! i have a thousand thoughts about pete and patrick and the deep understanding they‚Äôve built through their commitment to creative collaboration over the years‚Äîbut they‚Äôve always said it better themselves than i ever could.</p>

<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0aW2wxU16UTuwohjldJ5v0?si=5e4d77805edd4d13">black eye</a> by vernon. i cannot emphasise enough how much this song is straight out of the pop punk heyday years. it‚Äôs not derivative, or inspired, or a fresh new take. it belongs right back there in the trenches of 2006.</p>

<h2>currently watching</h2>
<p>audrey and i finished season 2 of <em>young royals</em> and it was fantastic. i was on the edge of my seat the entire time! i thought the tension built up so perfectly; when wille stood up to give his speech after spending the entire episode having an extreme anxiety breakdown, i genuinely had no idea how it was going to go. and then when he went off script and said ‚Äúfuck tradition, that was me having gay sex in that video! and i liked it!‚Äù i was shaking crying screaming throwing up. period!!! as totally ridiculous as the whole premise of this show is, what i love is that at its core it‚Äôs about letting yourself seize the love that is there for the taking; about being open and honest and loyal; about trying to do right by someone else. when simon said i love you to wille i felt it physically in my chest. no notes whatsoever! perfect television! season 3 can‚Äôt come soon enough!</p>
<p>i also started watching <em>sherwood</em>. sorry but it‚Äôs january and sometimes you just need a hit of copaganda! there‚Äôs something so profoundly relaxing and compelling about the beats of these bbc procedural shows. this one takes place in a nottinghamshire mining village, which was predominantly a UDM town during the strikes (aka breaking the NUM line and going back to work in the pits). although it‚Äôs set 30 years on, the town‚Äôs memory is long and the scars of that divisive time still haven‚Äôt healed. i‚Äôm intrigued, but also prepared to roll my eyes at whatever half-baked political analysis is inserted in there.</p>

<h2>last seen</h2>
<p>hareem and i watched <em>eternal sunshine of the spotless mind</em> on the weekend, which i‚Äôd never seen before. i found it very moving, but in a hopeful sort of way. made me think a lot about love and loss and change and failure and trying. how loving someone else means seeing them fully, the less-than-perfect parts, the parts that they might rather hide. and in turn, opening yourself up to being seen by them. a quote i saw floating around on the internet recently: ‚Äúlove is messy but growth from love is realistic and profound‚Äù. &amp; that growth means being honest with yourself about the messy parts, the things you aren‚Äôt proud of saying or doing, the moments you wish you could take back. loving people means knowing that they have the capacity to hurt you, just as you have the capacity to hurt them. and the movie says: <em>yes, we‚Äôre all flawed, and sometimes we hurt each other. but what if we loved each other through that? what if we stayed, what if we tried? what if we risk the heart?</em> even if it fails, even if you make the same mistakes, even if you get hurt again. and no matter what, it‚Äôs all worth remembering.</p>
<p>here‚Äôs <a href="https://griefbacon.substack.com/p/eavesdropping">helena fitzgerald</a> on the topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we are in the new year, and I want every lesson to be about love. Tell me a story about how the unlikely things work out; tell me about how people stay together when everyone thinks they shouldn‚Äôt. Tell me about the bad, rash decisions that last through time, that make it down the years. Tell me that there are rooms where nobody else can go, where best practices and good wisdom cannot reach. Tell me everyone was wrong about keeping your heart safe; tell me that there‚Äôs no way to do that anyway. Tell me that what is public is also private, that the known can stay unknown, that something precious can be hoarded away from the light. Tell me that the loud, show-off, screeching things can go home together in the quiet part of the night and close all the windows. Tell me I have more time left, that there is still something beautiful coming, that sometimes delusions work out, and that we can build a life on the thinnest and most selfish feeling, running blue with it down a long day, setting the end of the summer on fire. Tell me a big stupid story about love. Put love up on the projector in the town square so we can all stop our days, walking by on the way to run errands, to stand around and marvel that even now it still happens. Here in the cold at the bottom of the winter, I am looking in every stranger‚Äôs window, hoping that they‚Äôll tell me their secrets, and hoping that the secrets are about love.</p>

<h2>reading</h2>
<p>i recently finished zhang yueran‚Äôs <em>cocoon</em>, which was the first time i‚Äôve read a novel by a chinese writer that wasn‚Äôt genre fiction. i‚Äôm still mulling over my thoughts on it, but it made me think of a fanfiction siyang and i love which is tagged ‚Äúmommy issues‚Äù, ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù, ‚Äúissues‚Äù. feels appropriate for a novel about intergenerational trauma, buried secrets, loveless marriages and two deeply unhappy children who grow up in the shadow of all of this. it also prompted a conversation with hayley about the chinese fiction that gets preferentially translated into english, and what that says about the west‚Äôs voyeuristic preoccupation with certain parts of chinese history. like i said, still chewing on these things, but i‚Äôd definitely like to read more chinese novels this year. if anybody has recommendations, let me know!</p>
