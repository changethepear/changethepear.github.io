<em>diedrick brackens, 2017, how to return</em></p>
<p>hi, hello. a few people asked me whether i was planning to continue this substack while i‚Äôm in australia and the answer is you can‚Äôt get rid of me that easily! life is very overwhelming and my brain is in a constant state of adapting and adjusting to all the confusing things that are happening, but i‚Äôm trying to carve out time amidst all of that for my favourite activities: obsessing over things and sharing my thoughts.</p>

<h2>on repeat</h2>
<p>it‚Äôs time to talk about kim namjoon. his latest release is called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/512dQp7hBbDDurodCqSw5I?si=EENwQfosQuOVHGA3FYESWw">right place, wrong person</a> and guys, he has done it again: created a piece of art. i‚Äôve written before about his first album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2wGinO7YWLHN2sULIr4a7v?si=bt_K14WwTGiV2ok5_WOMAw">indigo</a>, and how vulnerable it was. rpwp is no less vulnerable, but it marks a distinct shift in emotional landscape. if indigo was, <em>here is my beating heart on a platter and it is furiously searching for a way to keep on living</em> then rpwp is <em>I LIVED BITCH!</em></p>
<p>listening to indigo, i got the sense that namjoon is asking for something‚Äîa chance to live, permission to keep on trying. rpwp isn‚Äôt asking anymore. the project has a sense of urgency about it‚Äînamjoon delayed his military service to work on the album, and it reflects that, i think. it‚Äôs something that <em>had</em> to exist so he could find peace. the kind of art you make when you‚Äôre trying to find your way back to yourself, when you‚Äôre wandering far from your friends and unsure where your tethers are.</p>
<p>like indigo, it has fantastic features: little simz and moses sumney! and like indigo it‚Äôs clear how much thought and consideration has gone into the construction of the album: its musicality, its instrumentation, its experimentation with genre. it feels <em>fun,</em> like namjoon is finally not holding back, finally throwing off the burden that has been weighing him down.</p>
<p>it‚Äôs unapologetic and unafraid. it‚Äôs a cigarette lit and thrown on a pyre, an angry fuck you to anyone who‚Äôs ever tried to box him in. it‚Äôs all of namjoon‚Äôs contractictions bound up in one piece of work. and what a brave and bold and beautiful gift that is.</p>
<p>side note: jimin and namjoon doing a listen-through of the album together ripped me and hayley apart. highly recommend for anyone who wants to watch someone who unconditionally loves another person think about and talk through the art one of them made at a dark time in their life.</p>

<h2>last seen</h2>
<p>audrey and i finished young royals season 3! the final episode made me scream, out loud, at least three times and i‚Äôve rewatched the final scene‚Ä¶ MANY times. listen‚Ä¶ sometimes a tv show gives you everything you want and everything you didn‚Äôt think you would get!!! i‚Äôll say it once agan: this show is about honesty and trying to do right by one another. wille and simon are so young. they‚Äôre teenagers, shouldering the difficulty of a private relationship made public‚Äîat first it was through forces out of their control, but by season three we‚Äôre made aware that wille‚Äôs role as prince means that their relationship is controlled and scrutinised by everyone from the cute six-year-old boy at the protest who wants a picture with simon, to the palace spin doctors who won‚Äôt let simon post on instagram, who want wille to be the poster boy of a cause for his birthday. wille understands the strictures‚Äîhe was raised inside them‚Äîbut simon doesn‚Äôt, and hates them. throughout the series we see them make compromises for each other, try their best, and eventually realise that love is not enough. and yet‚Ä¶ maybe it is enough. maybe you can make a choice that lets you be with the person you love. a choice not for them, but because of them. because of what they‚Äôve taught you and shown you through how they‚Äôve loved you. a choice for yourself. a choice for happiness.</p>
<p>LOVE WINS!</p>

<h2>currently watching</h2>
<p>i started house of the dragon, because i miss game of thrones (likely thing for me to do) and yet wanted something new. plus i saw <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/lonelyvampx/757761235042353152/house-of-the-dragon-modern-au">this</a> clip of the cast and thought, i need to watch this. i love when a cast bands together to bully the himbo. anyway, after episode one i immediately opened a wiki of ice and fire to clarify a few things‚Äîwe‚Äôre so fucking back. matthew warned me about the ‚Äútraumatic birthing scenes‚Äù in season 1 and he was not wrong. episode one kicks us off with a bang: king viserys opting to slice his wife open to retrieve the unborn child because he‚Äôs so obsessed with having a son, and subsequently watching her bleed out on the bed. a caesarian!!! with no medical equipment and no anaesthetic??? horrific. horrendous. lock that man up. anyway, apart from finding matt smith deeply unconvincing as the sexy rogue dragonlord prince daemon targaryen and being distracted by the truly appalling quality of some of the wigs, i‚Äôm having a good time! i am wary of saying who my favourites are because as we know, everything can change in an instant. i‚Äôm hoping for good, solid character development, motivations that make sense and a lot of beautiful gowns.</p>

<h2>reading</h2>
