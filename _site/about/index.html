<p>i like thinking about things a lot—if you know me at all, you will know that it is pretty much my permanent state to be obsessing over something. i guess i wanted a place i could archive those thoughts in a more long-form way than twitter or instagram. some of you might say: so…keep a diary, and to that i would say, you’re absolutely correct, but also i will never do that. so here we are.</p>
<p>this used to be hosted on substack and <a href="/posts/2025-04-17-goodbye-substack/">now is not</a>.</p>
<p>if you subscribe, every so often you’ll get a deeply unserious yet also incredibly sincere update on my current interests—what i’m reading, listening to, eating, watching and thinking about. buckle up!</p>
