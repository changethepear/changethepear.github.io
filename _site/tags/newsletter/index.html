           hello. we&#39;re about midway through winter over in the southern hemisphere (god willing) and the flu knocked me and hana for six towards the end of june, which i&#39;m still slowly recovering from. things in general have felt very slow here for a while now. i&#39;m trying to have patience with that.

           welcome to a whole new newsletter! (elete: the pear has literally been changed...) thanks for being patient with me while i battled web development and email services and eventually managed to code and host this new site. there might be some teething issues (let me know if you spot any!) but it&#39;s been a while since i wrote a newsletter and i really wanted to get one out as soon as i could. it&#39;s winter here and i&#39;ve been struggling to keep my head above water. i&#39;m hoping that writing this keeps me tethered; reminds me that joy is never far away. let&#39;s get into it.

           hello. january felt particularly long and brutal this year, so absolutely good riddance to that, although the grey dreariness of february isn‚Äôt much comfort. as we head into the end of the lunar year, i‚Äôm feeling sad to let the year of the rabbit go. i wrote last year: it‚Äôs a year of escaping demons, of running fast and free, of being swift and full of tricks, of becoming ungovernable, and i think the year reflected that in many different ways. but it‚Äôs time to look ahead to the year of the dragon: a year of burning bridges, of flying on the winds of morning, of myth and magic, of building a big hoard and keeping it safe.

           hello. can you believe the days are still getting shorter? i don‚Äôt know why the brutality of the winter dark always surprises me like this‚Äîsurely i should remember that 4pm in december feels like the middle of the night, when it happens every year. anyway, i hope you‚Äôre all surviving and managing to find joy and light where you can. everything passes, even december.

           hello! i‚Äôm back. someone (elete or hayley maybe?) once said that the year doesn‚Äôt start until lunar new year has passed, so here‚Äôs the first newsletter of the real new year. happy year of the rabbit! it‚Äôs a year of escaping demons, of running fast and free, of being swift and full of tricks, of becoming ungovernable. let‚Äôs get it.
