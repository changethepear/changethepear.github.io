<p>i love writing my newsletter but sometimes things slip through the cracks: i’m not in the mood to write, i’m depressed, i don’t have thoughts that feel Big enough. i’ll try to put smaller updates in here.</p>

<li>just crawled out of the website development process covered in blood. the perfectionist part of me is like, “there are sooooo many tweaks i could make to this” and the hyperfixated part of me is like, “good enough! time to subject everyone to your thoughts on the pitt”. who will win!</li>
<li>this morning it was -5 degrees but i still went to pilates (tues morning is my favourite instructor’s timeslot)</li>
<li>making kimchi fried rice for dinner</li>
<li>almost finished faithful place–not sure whether to move onto broken harbor or the secret place next</li>
