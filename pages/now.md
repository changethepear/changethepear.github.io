i love writing my newsletter but sometimes things slip through the cracks: i'm not in the mood to write, i'm depressed, i don't have thoughts that feel Big enough. i'll try to put smaller updates in here.

## june 3rd 2025

- just crawled out of the website development process covered in blood. the perfectionist part of me is like, "there are sooooo many tweaks i could make to this" and the hyperfixated part of me is like, "good enough! time to subject everyone to your thoughts on the pitt". who will win!
- this morning it was -5 degrees but i still went to pilates (tues morning is my favourite instructor's timeslot)
- making kimchi fried rice for dinner
- almost finished faithful place--not sure whether to move onto broken harbor or the secret place next
